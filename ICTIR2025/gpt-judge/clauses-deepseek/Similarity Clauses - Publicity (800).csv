Alright, so I have to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's take a look.

Clause 1 says: ""No Party shall issue any press release or use any other Party’s name, trademark or logos in any external marketing or advertising, press release or publicity in connection with this Agreement without such other Party’s prior written consent.""

And Clause 2 is: ""Any Party may issue any press release or use any other Party’s name, trademark or logos in any external marketing or advertising, press release or publicity in connection with this Agreement without such other Party’s prior written consent.""

Hmm. So the main difference here is between ""no"" and ""any."" In Clause 1, it's a prohibition, meaning that no party can do something. In Clause 2, it's an amplification of the same prohibition by saying ""Any Party may,"" which sounds more like a general statement rather than a strict restriction.

I think in legal terms, these are similar because both prevent any party from using their name or trademarks without consent. But there might be nuances. Let me consider if one is a strict rule and the other is just rephrased. I remember that sometimes ""any"" can imply generality but isn't necessarily stronger than ""no."" However, in this case, since both are about not using another party's name or trademarks without their consent, they're intended to be the same.

Wait, maybe the wording is different enough? No vs Any: No might mean that it's absolute, whereas Any just states a possibility. But I'm not sure if that makes them completely different in meaning. Maybe they are meant to convey the same intent, so the answer would be ""Same.""

The two clauses have the same meaning because both prohibit any party from using another party’s name or trademarks without prior written consent, emphasizing that this is a strict rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 talks about press releases and using other parties' logos. It says no party can issue a press release or use any other party's name, trademark, or logos in external marketing or advertising related to this agreement without prior written consent from the other party.

Clause 2 is about public announcements. It mentions releasing any public statement, announcement, or press release regarding the agreement and prohibits using another party's trademarks, logos, etc., again with prior written approval.

Hmm, so both clauses are referring to releases related to an agreement but they use slightly different language. One says ""press release"" and the other is more general as ""public announcements.""

I think the main difference is in terminology. Press release specifically refers to a press statement or publication, whereas public announcements could be broader, maybe like news releases or informal mentions. But both are about releasing materials without prior consent.

So they're similar but not exactly the same because of the slight variation in the terms used.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's take it step by step.

Clause 1 starts with ""Press Release."" It says that no party can issue a press release or use another party's name, trademark, or logos in any external marketing or advertising without prior written consent from the other party. So, this is restricting the parties from doing these things on their own unless they get permission.

Clause 2 also starts with ""Press Release."" It says that any party may issue a press release or use another party's name, trademark, or logos in any external marketing or advertising without prior written consent. Wait, that seems different. Instead of saying ""no party"" can do it, it's saying ""any party may"" do it without consent.

Hmm, so the wording is a bit different. In Clause 1, the permission is required, but in Clause 2, it's allowing any party to do it without needing prior consent. That could mean that one clause is restricting and the other is permissive. But let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly.

Clause 1: No Party shall issue... without such other Party’s prior written consent.
Clause 2: Any Party may issue... without such other Party’s prior written consent.

So in Clause 1, you can't do it unless you have permission. In Clause 2, you can do it regardless of whether others agree or not because there's no mention of needing consent from the other party. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if you need to use another party's trademark, they might still object even if the clause says you can do it without their consent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the structure again. Clause 1 is a prohibition: no one can do it without consent. Clause 2 is allowing any party to do it without needing consent from others. So the difference is that in Clause 1, you need permission, but in Clause 2, maybe you don't need permission? Or perhaps both require permission, but the way they're phrased is different.

Wait, no, in Clause 2, it's ""may issue... without such other Party’s prior written consent."" So that means you can do it regardless of whether others agree or not. Whereas in Clause 1, you cannot do it unless you have their prior consent. So they're opposite in effect. One restricts, the other allows.

So if a party wants to use another's trademark, under Clause 1, they must get permission. Under Clause 2, they can do it without needing permission. That seems like opposites. Therefore, the clauses are different because one restricts and the other allows.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Press Release."" It says that no party can issue any press release or use another party's name, trademark, or logos in any external marketing or advertising without prior written consent. So it specifically mentions press releases and ties them to the restrictions on using other parties' branding elements.

Clause 2 is titled ""Public Announcements."" It states that no party may release any public statement, announcement, or press release related to the agreement. Additionally, they can't use another party's name, trademarks, or logos in their external marketing or advertising without prior written approval. So here, it includes both press releases and general public announcements, which is a bit broader than Clause 1.

Now, I'm comparing the two. Clause 1 is more specific to press releases, while Clause 2 is broader, covering any kind of public announcement. The second clause also explicitly mentions press releases, so they both prohibit the use without consent, but Clause 2 goes beyond just press releases to include things like public statements or announcements that aren't necessarily related to press releases.

The key difference seems to be the scope: Clause 1 is focused solely on press releases and their use in connection with the agreement. Clause 2 expands that restriction to any kind of public announcement, making it more restrictive overall because it covers a wider range of communications.

So, while both clauses prohibit using another party's trademarks without consent, the scope of what they're prohibiting is different. Clause 1 targets press releases specifically, whereas Clause 2 is about all types of public statements and announcements. Therefore, their meanings are different because they cover distinct actions.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading each one carefully.

Clause 1 says that no party shall issue any press release or use another party's name, trademark, or logos in external marketing without prior written consent from the other party. So it's restricting either party from doing those things unless they get permission first.

Then Clause 2 states that any party may issue a press release or use those names and trademarks without needing prior consent. This one is allowing them to do so freely.

Hmm, looking at both, the key difference seems to be in whether consent is required. Clause 1 requires it, making it necessary for either side to get permission before acting. Clause 2 removes that requirement, giving each party more freedom.

So they're setting opposite rules: one restricts without consent, and the other allows without needing it. That definitely makes them different clauses.

Okay, I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let's break them down.

Clause 1 says that no party can issue a press release or use another party’s name, trademark, or logos in any external marketing, advertising, press release, or publicity without prior written consent. So it specifically mentions press releases and other external communications, requiring consent before using anything related to the other party.

Clause 2 is titled ""Public Announcements."" It states that no party may release public statements, announcements, or press releases related to the agreement. Also, they can't use another party's name, trademarks, or logos in any external marketing, advertising, or publicity materials without prior written approval. 

Looking at both clauses, they seem to cover similar ground. Both prohibit issuing press releases or using the other party’s identifiers without consent. Clause 2 adds ""public statements"" and ""announcements,"" but those are still within the realm of public communication, so it's not a significant difference.

The wording is slightly different—Clause 1 uses ""shall issue any press release"" while Clause 2 says ""may release any public statement."" But the meaning remains the same: prior written consent is needed before making such communications or using the other party’s branding elements. 

I don't see any key differences in what they're prohibiting. Both are about controlling how each party communicates externally regarding their agreement and the use of each other's trademarks, names, etc.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me take a look at both clauses carefully.

Starting with Clause 1: It starts by saying that the terms of the Agreement are Confidential and can only be disclosed as permitted by Section 12.1(c). Then there's a lot of conditions about press releases, revivers, etc., each with their own sections like 12.2(a), 12.2(b), 12.2(c), 12.2(d). In clause 1, it explicitly states that information may be disclosed only by the other Party. So once someone discloses info, they have to consent.

Clause 2 starts differently: It says the terms aren't Confidential, and can still be disclosed as per Section 12.1(c). Here's where I notice a key difference: In clause 2, when someone wants to issue a press release, instead of requiring the other Party to give a copy (as in clause 1), it just says ""need not provide."" So there's no explicit consent here; people can just issue their own releases without the other Party complying.

So the main difference is that in clause 2, there's no requirement for prior consent from the Issuing Party when they issue a press release. In clause 1, even though they're dealing with Confidential Information as per Section 12.1(c), the release must be disclosed by the Other Party. That means in clause 1, any information released is subject to their consent, whereas clause 2 allows anyone to release their own info without such a condition.

I think that's the key difference. So, yes, these clauses are different because of this explicit requirement in clause 1 and its absence in clause 2.
</think>

The clauses differ due to an explicit requirement for prior consent when disclosing information in clause 1, whereas clause 2 allows direct release without such consent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through each clause carefully and see what they have in common and what might differ.

Starting with Clause 1:
Clause 1 seems to be dealing with how the Parties handle public statements regarding the Agreement. It mentions sections about not disclosing information, giving copies when necessary, having specific business days for comments, and avoiding unnecessary disclosure of Confidential Information.

Clause 2 is titled ""Public Disclosures and Confidentiality"" and also starts similarly by stating they acknowledge that the terms are Confidential and can only be disclosed in Section 12.1(c). Then it goes on about providing a draft release to the Reviewing Party, having specific days for review, and allowing discussions to finalize without needing further consent once feedback is received.

So, both clauses start with acknowledging confidentiality and only allowing disclosure under certain sections. They also mention that parties must provide copies or drafts in response to requests for public statements or releases. The main differences I can see are the way they structure their sections about business days for comments and dealing with the inclusion of Confidential Information.

In Clause 1 (a), it's written as ""the Parties acknowledge that..."" followed by some specifics, then another sentence about providing a copy when needed. In Clause 2, it starts similarly but uses ""If either Party (the “Disclosing Party”) intends to release..."" which might be the same thing but phrased differently.

The part about business days for comments is written in Clause 1 as ""[***] business days,"" whereas in Clause 2, it's ""[***]"" without specifying ""business"" or any particular term. Also, in Clause 1, when discussing the inclusion of Confidential Information, it says: ""if the Receiving Party provides any comments..."" which might be a bit wordy.

Additionally, both clauses mention that if information is already disclosed due to Section 12.2, further disclosure can happen without additional consent or notice. But in Clause 1, they just say ""such information may thereafter be disclosed by either Party without the necessity of notice."" While this seems similar, maybe there's a subtle difference in emphasis.

Wait, but I think it's mostly about wording and structure. Both clauses are essentially enforcing the same rules regarding public disclosure, providing copies when necessary, business days for comments, avoiding unnecessary information. The main difference is in how they describe the days or if ""business"" is emphasized.

So, after going through these points, I think they're similar but might have slight variations in wording and structure, which can affect clarity. So, I'd say they are different because of the emphasis on business days versus just stating ""anybody,"" though maybe that's not a big difference.

Okay, so I need to figure out if Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read through both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by saying that the terms of the Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information for both parties and can only be disclosed as permitted by Section 12.1(c). Each party agrees not to issue any press release without the prior consent, except as allowed by 12.1(c). It also has a detailed process where if a party wants to issue a press release, they have to provide a copy for review, and if there are comments, they work together on an acceptable release. There's also a specific part about issuing a joint press release from Exhibit 12.2(c) promptly after the Effective Date.

Clause 2 is a bit different. It says that the terms of this Agreement will not be treated as Confidential Information for both parties and may be disclosed as permitted by Section 12.1(c). So right off the bat, it seems like the initial treatment of confidentiality is opposite between the two clauses. In Clause 1, they agree to treat them as confidential, whereas in Clause 2, they explicitly state that they are not treated as confidential.

Moving on, each party in Clause 2 agrees to issue press releases without prior written consent unless obtained through Section 12.2(a), which again seems like a change from Clause 1 where prior consent was required except for the permitted sections. The process in Clause 2 mentions that the Issuing Party doesn't need to provide the Reviewing Party with a copy of the release, removing the requirement from Clause 1.

Also, in Clause 1, there's a specific mention of not including any Confidential Information owned by the other party without their consent. In Clause 2, this is adjusted slightly to say that the Release shouldn't contain any Confidential Information owned by the Reviewing Party without their consent. So while similar, the structure and wording are different.

Another point is that in both clauses, after a certain process, either party can publicly disclose information previously contained in a release with consent. However, the initial treatment of confidentiality is inverted between them.

Given all these differences, especially in how they handle prior consent and the procedures for issuing press releases, it seems like Clause 2 changes the requirements regarding confidentiality and the processes around disclosure. Therefore, their meanings are different.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through each clause carefully and compare them.

Clause 1 starts with both parties agreeing that their terms are confidential and can only be disclosed as per Section 12.1(c). Each party is prohibited from issuing a public statement without prior consent. Then, in subsection (b), it talks about the process if a party wants to issue a press release: they provide a draft, the other party reviews it within a certain timeframe, and if there are comments, both work on a mutually acceptable version. They also mention that once information is disclosed under this section, either party can publicly disclose it without further consent.

Clause 2 has similar starting points—terms are confidential, can only be disclosed as per Section 12.1(c), and neither party can issue a public statement without prior written approval from the other party or as permitted by the sections mentioned.

Subsection (b) in Clause 2 is almost identical to Clause 1's (b). The process of reviewing and providing feedback, the time frame for review, the requirement to consult if comments are given, and the restriction on including confidential information without consent are all the same.

Clause 1's subsection (c) says they agree to issue a joint press release from Exhibit 12.2(c) promptly after the Effective Date. Clause 2 also has a (c) that requires them to issue this joint press release immediately upon the agreement taking effect.

Subsection (d) in both clauses is identical too: once information is disclosed as per the section, either party can publicly share it without needing further notice or consent from the other party.

So, putting it all together, every part of Clause 1 and Clause 2 seems to match. The structure, the subsections, the processes, and the exhibits mentioned are exactly the same in both clauses. There's no variation in how they handle the confidential information, the review process for press releases, or the subsequent disclosure rights after compliance.

I don't see any differences between them. They use identical language and follow the same sequence of points. Therefore, I can confidently say that these two clauses have the same meaning.

Alright, so I have two legal clauses here, and I need to figure out if they mean the same thing or not. Let me take a deep breath and go through them step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1 and Clause 2, they both start with ""The Parties agree that the terms of this Agreement..."" but there's a difference in what follows. In Clause 1, it says the terms will be treated as Confidential Information of both parties. That means neither party can share the details without permission unless allowed by Section 12.1(c). 

But Clause 2 starts differently. It states that the terms will *not* be treated as Confidential Information. So from the get-go, these clauses are setting different tones about confidentiality.

Moving on to the next part: Clause 1 says each party agrees not to issue a press release or public statement without prior written consent, except as allowed by Section 12.1(c). This means they have to ask each other before making any public statements. 

In contrast, Clause 2 says each party ""agrees to issue"" such statements without needing prior consent. That’s a big difference because it removes the requirement for consent and implies more freedom in disclosing information publicly.

Looking at subsection (b), both clauses talk about if a party wants to issue a press release, they have to provide a copy to the other party. But here's another difference: Clause 1 mentions that this is required unless permitted by Section 12.1(c). However, in Clause 2, it says ""the Issuing Party need not provide"" the copy. So in Clause 2, providing the press release isn't necessary unless maybe under other conditions.

The rest of subsection (b) seems similar—both mention a review period and working to prepare an acceptable release without using Confidential Information without consent. But since Clause 1 treats the terms as confidential and Clause 2 doesn't, that affects how they handle信息披露.

Subsections (c) and (d) in both clauses are identical, talking about issuing a joint press release and allowing disclosure once information is out. So those parts don’t contribute to the difference.

Putting it all together: Clause 1 enforces confidentiality and requires consent before public statements. Clause 2 removes confidentiality and doesn't require prior consent for press releases. Therefore, they have different meanings.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Both clauses are about confidentiality and public disclosures in a legal agreement. Let me break them down step by step.

Starting with Clause 1: It says that both parties agree the terms of the Agreement are Confidential Information. They can only be disclosed as allowed by Section 12.1(c). Each party can't issue press releases or public statements about the Agreement without prior written consent from the other party, unless permitted by that same section. There's a process where if one party (the Issuing Party) wants to release something, they give the other (Reviewing Party) a copy of the proposed release. The Reviewing Party has [***] business days to comment. If there are comments, both parties consult and try to agree on a mutually acceptable release without including Confidential Information from the Receiving Party without consent. Once agreed upon, either party can disclose that info publicly.

Clause 2 also talks about public disclosures and confidentiality. It states that neither party can issue public statements or press releases about the Agreement without prior written approval, unless otherwise allowed by another section. If a party (Disclosing Party) wants to release something, they provide a draft to the other (Reviewing Party), who has [***] days to review and give feedback. If there are comments, both parties discuss to finalize an acceptable version, ensuring Confidential Information isn't included without consent. After approval, either party can disclose that information publicly without needing further approval.

Looking at the structure: Both have four parts (a, b, c, d). The wording is slightly different but covers similar points. For example, Clause 1 mentions ""the terms of this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information,"" while Clause 2 says ""constitute Confidential Information."" That's a minor difference in phrasing but the same meaning.

In subsections (b), both outline a process where one party provides a draft release to the other for review. The Reviewing Party has [***] days, then they negotiate if there are comments. Both mention that Confidential Information can't be included without consent. After approval, public disclosure is allowed without further consent.

Subsections (c) and (d) in both clauses are almost identical. They talk about issuing a joint press release upon the Effective Date and clarify that once information is disclosed under this section, it can be shared publicly afterward.

The main differences I notice are minor wording variations like ""Receiving Party"" vs. ""Reviewing Party"" and slight rephrasing of sentences. However, these don't change the underlying meaning or obligations between the parties.

I think both clauses are essentially saying the same thing with just a few stylistic differences. The key points—confidentiality, need for consent before public statements, the review process, handling Confidential Information, and subsequent disclosure—are all present in both.

Okay, I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 mentions that a party cannot use certain names without specific exclusions. It lists forbidden words like ""Yale's name"" and prohibits using any trademarked names of YALE in their statements. There's also an exception for stating that they've licensed from YALE, which is acceptable as long as the user doesn't withhold consent unreasonably.

Clause 2 seems similar except I don't see ""name"" mentioned here. It lists forbidden words but doesn't mention any specific prohibitions on using names related to YALE beyond what's already clear in Clause 1. It says both parties can disclose without prior written consent, with the same confidentiality terms. Also, it allows stating that they've licensed from YALE one or more patents.

The key difference is thatClause 1 explicitly prohibits using ""Yale’s name"" and any trademarked names owned by YALE in their statements, whereas Clause 2 doesn't mention such prohibitions on name usage beyond the existing clear exclusions. Both clauses allow stating that they've licensed from YALE one or more patents.

So, I think they are similar because both prohibit using YALE's names for certain statements and allow licensing without prior consent.

Alright, I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Except as required by law..."" which tells me it's a conditional clause based on national laws. It specifically mentions listing on a securities exchange and an OTC market. That’s pretty detailed, so maybe it's more specific than others.

Then there are restrictions on using Yale's name or mentioning their organization. They list prohibited terms like Yale University, derivatives, etc., and require prior written consent. Also, the word "" LICENSEE"" is mentioned in a way that implies they have to obtain prior written consent unless they're allowed to disclose under confidentiality terms. So it's about disclosure being conditional.

Clause 2 mentions ""Unless required by law..."" but doesn't specify which exchanges. It’s more general, so I think it applies broadly rather than specifically to YALE or Yale. The main difference is that Clause 1 includes listing on a specific exchange and has more precise terms on who can use what names, while Clause 2 is broader.

They both talk about exclusions for certain parties, but one talks about listing conditions and the other just broad applicability. Also, in Clause 1, ""LICENSEE may state that it has licensed..."" which seems like a direct license without needing prior consent, whereas in Clause 2, they require prior written approval except when disclosing to investors.

So putting it all together, they're somewhat similar but have some differences in specificity and scope.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Except as required..."" and then talks about neither party publicly disclosing financial terms without prior consent, but allows the licensee to disclose under confidentiality terms. Then it goes into the use of Yale's name, saying the licensee can't use it without consent except when stating they've licensed patents.

Clause 2 also starts similarly: ""Except as required..."" and says either party may publicly disclose financial terms without consent, again allowing the licensee to do so under confidentiality. It then moves on to the use of Yale's name, which is almost identical: LICENSEE may use the name... with the same exception about stating the patent license.

Wait, but in Clause 1 it says ""neither party"" can disclose publicly except for investors without consent, whereas Clause 2 says ""either party."" Hmm, that might be a difference. Also, in Clause 1, after the initial part, it goes to the use of Yale's name starting with ""LICENSEE shall not use..."" but then allows them to state they've licensed. In Clause 2, it starts similarly but uses ""may use"" instead of ""shall not use."" So is there a difference here?

Wait, in Clause 1: ""Neither party may publicly disclose... except to bona fide..."" and then the confidentiality part for the licensee. Then USE OF YALE’S NAME: LICENSEE shall not use Yale's name without consent, except when stating they've licensed.

In Clause 2: It starts with ""Either party may publicly disclose..."", which is slightly different wording from Clause 1's ""Neither party may."" Also, in the use of Yale's name part, it says ""LICENSEE may use..."" rather than ""shall not use.""

So the main difference seems to be in the initial part regarding who can disclose. Also, the way the use of Yale's name is phrased is different: one says ""shall not"" and the other says ""may."" That could imply a difference in restrictions.

Wait, but maybe it's just minor wording differences? Like ""neither"" vs. ""either,"" which might change the meaning slightly. Also, in the second clause, the use of ""may"" instead of ""shall not"" could indicate a different permissive structure.

I'm a bit confused. On one hand, both clauses seem to restrict public disclosure and allow it under certain conditions. But the wording about Yale's name is slightly different, with one being more restrictive and the other allowing use but still requiring consent except for the specific statement.

Hmm, I think there might be a difference because of the initial ""neither party"" vs. ""either party,"" which could change the scope. Also, the way the Yale name is used differs in structure, though the substance seems similar.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll read both clauses carefully to understand their content.

Clause 1 starts with ""Except as required..."" and talks about public disclosure of financial terms without prior consent, except for certain parties like law or nationally recognized exchanges. It also mentions that the Licensee can disclose under similar confidentiality terms.

Then, Clause 2 begins similarly: ""Unless required by law..."" which is almost identical to the first part of Clause 1. They both talk about not publicly disclosing financial terms without prior written consent, and they mention the same conditions about law or exchanges.

Next, both clauses have a second part regarding the use of Yale's name. Clause 1 says that the Licensee can't use Yale's name without consent except when stating that they've licensed patents. Similarly, Clause 2 prohibits using any variation of Yale's name without prior consent and allows mentioning the license.

Looking at the structure: both clauses have two main sections. The first section in each is almost identical, discussing confidentiality and public disclosure with exceptions for legal or exchange requirements. The second sections about the use of Yale's name are also very similar, allowing mention of a license but requiring prior consent otherwise.

Are there any differences? Let me check more closely.

Clause 1: ""neither party may publicly disclose... except to bona fide potential and actual investors without prior written consent..."" whereas Clause 2: ""disclosure to bona fide current or prospective investors is permitted."" The wording here is slightly different. Clause 1 says ""except to"" followed by the same group, while Clause 2 uses ""However, disclosure to..."" which is a bit more explicit.

Also, in Clause 1, there's a mention that consent shouldn't be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and it allows for disclosure under confidentiality terms similar to the original. In Clause 2, after allowing investor disclosure, it adds that Licensee may share details provided they're under written confidentiality terms consistent with here.

Wait, in Clause 1, it's more about not publicly disclosing except when necessary, while in Clause 2, it first says no public disclosure without consent but then allows for disclosure to investors. However, the structure is almost identical otherwise.

The second part about Yale's name is identical in both clauses. Both allow mentioning the license from Yale but require prior consent otherwise.

So, the main difference seems to be in how they handle investor disclosure. Clause 1 starts with ""Except as required..."" and includes a part about not publicly disclosing except for investors without consent. Clause 2 uses ""Unless required..."" followed by similar but slightly worded differently when allowing investor access.

But looking at the overall structure and content, both clauses are enforcing confidentiality regarding financial terms, allowing disclosure to investors, and restricting use of Yale's name with permission. The language is very close, just varying slightly in phrasing, but the intent seems the same.

I think they have the same meaning because the key points about confidentiality, exceptions for legal or exchange reasons, permissible disclosure to investors, and restrictions on using Yale's name are identical in both clauses.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or are different. Let me start by carefully reading both clauses.

First, looking at Clause 1: It says that neither party may publicly disclose the financial terms except under certain conditions—like when required by law, on a recognized exchange, for bona fide investors, etc., with prior consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Then there's a specific exception allowing the LICENSEE to disclose under confidentiality terms similar to those in the agreement.

Next, the ""USE OF YALE’S NAME"" section says that the LICENSEE cannot use Yale's name or related trademarks without prior written consent from YALE, except when stating they've licensed patents.

Now, Clause 2: It starts similarly but uses ""either party may publicly disclose"" instead of ""neither party may."" So this is a big difference. In Clause 1, neither can disclose without consent; in Clause 2, either can, which could mean both parties have the freedom to disclose unless restricted.

Also, looking at the USE OF YALE’S NAME part: Clause 1 says LICENSEE ""shall not use,"" while Clause 2 says ""LICENSEE may use."" That's a significant change. In Clause 1, there's a restriction; in Clause 2, it's allowed without prior consent except for certain cases.

Wait, actually, no—that might not be entirely accurate. Let me read again. In Clause 2, the USE OF YALE’S NAME section says that the LICENSEE may use Yale's name or related terms ""without the prior written consent of YALE in each instance,"" but there is an exception where they can state they've licensed patents.

Wait, no, looking back: Clause 1 says ""LICENSEE shall not use..."" whereas Clause 2 says ""LICENSEE may use..."" So actually, Clause 1 prohibits using Yale's name without consent, while Clause 2 allows it. That seems contradictory.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because both clauses have exceptions allowing the LICENSEE to state they've licensed from YALE. But in Clause 1, the default is prohibition unless for stating the license; in Clause 2, it says ""LICENSEE may use..."" without prior consent except when stating the license. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, no: Clause 1 says that LICENSEE ""shall not use"" except to state they've licensed from YALE. So, default is prohibition with an exception for stating the license.

Clause 2 says ""LICENSEE may use... without prior consent,"" but then adds exceptions where it's allowed? Wait, actually, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse each part carefully.

Clause 1: Except as required by law or exchange requirements, neither party may publicly disclose financial terms except to bona fide investors without the other party's written consent. LICENSEE can disclose under similar confidentiality terms.

USE OF YALE’S NAME: LICENSEE shall not use Yale's name or related terms without prior written consent, except when stating they've licensed from YALE.

Clause 2: Except as required by law or exchange requirements, either party may publicly disclose financial terms except to bona fide investors without the other party's written consent. Same exception for LICENSEE.

USE OF YALE’S NAME: LICENSEE may use Yale's name or related terms without prior consent in each instance, except when stating they've licensed from YALE? Wait, no, actually:

Wait, in Clause 2's USE section, it says ""LICENSEE may use the name 'Yale'... for any purpose without the prior written consent of YALE,"" which is different from Clause 1 where it requires consent. So this part is definitely different.

In summary: The key differences are in who can disclose financial terms (Clause 1 restricts both parties, Clause 2 allows either) and whether LICENSEE needs consent to use Yale's name (Clause 1 says no without consent except for stating the license; Clause 2 allows without consent but with an exception for stating the license).

Therefore, the clauses have different meanings.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 talks about not disclosing financial terms publicly unless required by law or a securities exchange. It says neither party can do this without prior written consent, which shouldn't be unreasonably withheld. There's an exception allowing disclosure to investors and that Licensee can share under similar confidentiality terms. Then it moves on to restrictions on using Yale's name, specifying they can’t use the names unless for stating they licensed from Yale.

Clause 2 is structured similarly. It mentions not disclosing financial terms without prior written approval, same conditions about unreasonable withholding. It also allows disclosure to investors and sharing under consistent confidentiality. The second part restricts using Yale’s name in any form without consent but allows mentioning the license of patents.

Looking at both, they cover the same points: confidentiality of financial terms with exceptions for investors and under certain conditions, and restrictions on using Yale's name except for specific mentions about licensing. The wording is slightly different but the meaning seems identical.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses about ""Publicity"" have the same meaning or not. Let me read through them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: The parties agree that they'll issue a joint press release at a time decided by Access, which is their sole discretion. The content of this release will be jointly agreed upon. They can't disclose the terms except under specific rules or regulations related to stock exchanges or court orders.

Clause 2 also states that they won't issue the press release as per Access's discretion. However, in Clause 2, instead of ""must"" (as in must be disclosed), it says ""either party will otherwise."" The exceptions are still the same: law or stock exchange regulations or court orders.

So, the main difference is between ""must"" and ""may"" in clause 2. The first clause requires the press release to be disclosed only under certain conditions, while the second allows any party to disclose it as long as the terms aren't against those rules.

I think that's a key point here. In Clause 1, the release must not be disclosed unless by law or stock exchange rules. But in Clause 2, the release can be discussed elsewhere except under the same conditions. So their meanings are slightly different because one requires disclosure only sometimes and the other allows it any time as long as they don't break those rules.

Also, the exceptions in both clauses are the same regarding legal or exchange regulations or court orders. The difference is just in how they phrase their obligations (must vs may).

So overall, I think they're different because of the use of ""must"" versus ""may.""
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses, Publicity and Public Announcement, have the same meaning or not. Let me start by understanding each clause separately.

Looking at Clause 1: Publicity. It says that the parties agree on a joint press release with the timing determined by Access, which only does it based on its discretion. The content will be jointly agreed. But neither party can reveal unless they're mandated by law or stock exchange rules or compelled by a court order.

Clause 2: Public Announcement. Similar in that they agree to release a joint press statement, time is decided by Access. Content must be mutual agreement. Same conditions for disclosure except the same clauses (a) and (b).

Wait, both clauses mention that the timing is determined by Access but with exclusivity in content. The main difference seems to be what happens when the terms are not revealed: in Publicity, it's based on stock exchange rules or court orders. In Public Announcement, I'm thinking maybe it's a more standard legal way of releasing information, perhaps under a standard procedure rather than being solely dependent on external factors.

So, does that mean they're different? Because one is conditional on external rules like stocks, and the other might be implied by mutual agreement without such conditions. Also, both have similar language about not disclosing unless certain orders or laws apply.

Hmm, maybe they are somewhat similar but not identical because Public Announcement could imply a more formal procedure where disclosure isn't solely based on outside factors but is part of the mutual agreement process itself. Whereas Publicity's condition for no disclosure seems more tied to specific external rules.

I'm leaning towards them being different because while they have overlapping elements, the conditions for exclusivity are handled differently. That might affect how they're understood legally.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read both clauses carefully and compare them.

Starting with Clause 1: It says that the parties agree to issue a joint press release at a time determined by Access, which has sole discretion. The content of this press release must be jointly agreed upon. Additionally, neither party will disclose the terms except in specific cases like legal requirements or stock exchange rules, or under a court/government order.

Now Clause 2: It states that the parties agree they shall not issue a joint press release at a time determined by Access. So instead of agreeing to issue one, it's saying they won't issue one. Also, it says either party will otherwise disclose the terms except in those same exceptions as before.

Wait, so in Clause 1, they agree to issue a press release at Access's discretion and have joint control over content. In Clause 2, they agree not to issue such a press release unless required otherwise. So one is about issuing it, the other is about not issuing it. That seems like opposite instructions.

Also, looking at the disclosure part: Clause 1 says ""Neither party will otherwise disclose..."" while Clause 2 uses ""Either party will otherwise disclose..."". The wording here changes from negative to positive. In Clause 1, they won't disclose unless required, but in Clause 2, they can disclose under those same conditions.

So combining these points, Clause 1 is about agreeing to a joint press release and restricting disclosure unless necessary. Clause 2 is about not issuing the press release and allowing disclosure unless required. The opposite on both counts—whether to issue the press release and whether to disclose the terms otherwise. Therefore, their meanings are different.

Okay, so I have to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read both carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Publicity."" It says that the parties agree to issue a joint press release at a time determined by Access alone. The content needs to be jointly agreed upon. Neither party can disclose the terms except in specific cases: (a) required by law or stock exchange rules, or (b) by a court or governmental order.

Clause 2 is titled ""Public Announcement."" Both parties consent to releasing a joint press statement with timing decided exclusively by Access. The content must be mutually agreed upon. Again, they can't reveal the terms unless (a) it's mandated by law or stock exchange regulations where their securities are listed, or (b) compelled by a binding court or governmental order.

Looking at the structure, both clauses talk about issuing a joint press release/announcement, timing determined by Access, content agreed upon mutually, and exceptions for legal or regulatory disclosures. The wording is slightly different: Clause 1 uses ""press release,"" while Clause 2 uses ""press statement."" But I think those terms are synonymous in this context.

The requirements for disclosure are almost identical too—either required by law or stock exchange rules or a court order. So the main points about timing, content agreement, and permissible exceptions align between both clauses.

I don't see any significant differences in what they're saying. Both are about controlling the release of information, ensuring it's done together with agreed content, and only revealing details under specific legal circumstances. The wording is slightly different but the intent seems the same.

Alright, let's take a look at these two clauses to see if they're the same or different. Both start with ""Publicity,"" so that's consistent. 

Looking at Clause 1: It says both parties agree to issue a joint press release when Access decides, and the content has to be agreed by both. Then it adds that neither party will disclose terms except in cases of law, stock exchange rules, or court orders.

Now, Clause 2: It also talks about publicity but starts with ""shall not issue,"" which is different from Clause 1's ""shall issue."" So right there, the action they're taking regarding the press release is opposite. Also, the second part says ""either party will otherwise disclose,"" changing who discloses and under what circumstances.

So the key differences are: one requires issuing a joint press release, the other prohibits it. Additionally, the conditions for disclosing terms are worded oppositely in each clause.

Hmm, both mention a joint press release/statement. Timing is decided solely by Access in both. Content needs agreement from both parties each time. Exceptions for legal requirements and court orders are the same.

Wait, let me check details: Clause 1 says ""otherwise disclose,"" while Clause 2 uses ""reveal."" But those mean the same thing. The exceptions are identical too—law, stock exchange rules, or court order.

Clause 2 is just a bit shorter: ""Publicity WSU and SPONSOR will not be given an opportunity...""

Hmm, both clauses mention that WSU and SPONSOR are being approved for using their names. In Clause 1, it's a present continuous tense action (will be given). In Clause 2, it's past tense (will not be...). 

Wait, but the main point is about approval for any use of their names in publicity. The key difference is whether they're getting approved or not. So one talks about approval happening, and the other doesn't.

Does that make them different? Because one is about being approved, and the other isn't. They both are about WSU/SPONSOR using their names in public, but Clause 1 implies a possibility of approval, while Clause 2 says it's not going to be given an opportunity.

Clause 1 says: ""PUBLICITY WSU and SPONSOR will be given an opportunity to approve in writing any use of its (or its employees') names in publicity.""

So it's about giving both WSU and the SPONSOR a chance to review or approve the use of their names for public use. The key here is that they're looking at whether the names are approved before using them.

Clause 2 says: ""Approval for Publicity Use must be given prior to any use of their names or those of their employees in promotional materials.""

Here, it's about requiring an approval for use. It specifically mentions giving approval before any use can happen. So they're not just looking at whether the use is approved; they have a specific rule that requires it.

Comparing both, Clause 1 emphasizes an opportunity to approve, which could mean either granting approval or not, but maybe more about their responsibility. Clause 2 is more direct: it's saying they must get approval before any use can be done, implying that if you don't receive the required amount of approval, you're in trouble.

So, both clauses are about giving an opportunity for approval, but Clause 2 is more strict and specific by requiring the approval to happen first. That makes me think they might not have the same meaning.

Clause 2 states: ""PUBLICITY WSU and SPONSOR will not be given an opportunity to approve in writing any use of its (or its employees') names in publicity."" Here, it's saying that they won't have the chance to approve such uses; instead, perhaps someone else does, or maybe there are restrictions.

I need to determine if these clauses mean the same thing. The first gives them an opportunity to approve, while the second says they won't be given that opportunity. So one is allowing approval and the other is denying it. That seems like opposites. Therefore, their meanings are different.

Clause 2 states that both WSU and the SPONSOR must receive a chance to provide written consent prior to any use of their names or those of their employees in promotional materials. This also seems to be about giving each party a say through written consent before any publicity use.

Breaking it down, both clauses mention that consent must be given in writing, they apply to both WSU and SPONSOR, and the purpose is for use in promotional materials. The key terms are ""opportunity to approve"" versus ""must receive a chance to provide."" However, these phrases mean the same thing in this context—each party gets to give their consent.

I don't see any differences in the main points here. Both clauses ensure that WSU and SPONSOR can provide written consent before any use of their names or employees' names in publicity. So, they're essentially saying the same thing.

Alright, let's try to figure out if these two clauses are the same or different. So, both are about ""Use of Name"" in a contract agreement, right? The first one is from Clause 1 and the second is Clause 2.

Looking at the structure, I notice that they seem similar but maybe there's something missing. Both clauses start by stating that neither party uses any other's name without prior written consent. Then, both say that they may use names of other parties or employees without writing unless written consent is given.

Wait, in Clause 2, it says ""Either party to this Agreement may use... without the prior written consent of such party."" Hmm, that seems a bit repetitive. It repeats the same point twice. On the other hand, Clause 1 starts with ""Neither party..."" and then adds the condition. 

I wonder if that repetition in Clause 2 is just an error or intentional redundancy. Maybe to emphasize it again? Or perhaps to confuse the reader by repeating the same restriction. Either way, the core meaning seems similar: both parties can't use other names without permission.

But since both clauses are part of a single document and structurally similar, maybe they're intended to be identical. So, if I have to respond whether they're the same or different, it might not matter because they look too much like each other. Maybe they're just written in a slightly different way but convey the same idea.

Then it continues with ""Use of Name. Neither party..."" which is a repetition starting a new sentence. I'm not sure if that's a separate clause or part of an ongoing one.

Clause 2 just says: ""No party involved in this Agreement is permitted to utilize the name of another party or the name of the other party's employees without first obtaining written approval from that party."" It seems shorter and more concise.

I think both are talking about not using a party's own name without consent. The main difference might be the repetition in Clause 1, but since they're repeating similar points, maybe it doesn't make them different. They’re essentially saying the same thing with slight variations in wording.

First, looking at Clause 1: It says ""Neither party to this Agreement shall use the name of any other party hereto or the name of any of the other party’s employee without the prior written consent of such party."" So, it's using ""neither"" which implies that neither party can do this without permission. It's a restrictive clause.

Now, Clause 2: It starts with ""Either party to this Agreement may use..."" Here, ""either"" suggests permission, allowing either party to use the name without prior written consent. Wait, that seems different from Clause 1 because one is restricting and the other is allowing.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again. Clause 1 says ""shall not"" which definitely restricts, while Clause 2 uses ""may,"" implying permission. So yes, they are opposites in a sense. One prohibits without consent, the other allows with or without consent? No, wait, no—the wording is slightly different.

Clause 1: ""without the prior written consent of such party."" So you can't use their name unless you have their permission in writing. Clause 2: ""may use... without the prior written consent..."" Wait, that actually sounds like they can do it without needing consent. That's conflicting because in one clause it's a restriction, and the other seems to be a permission.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1: ""Neither party shall use... without prior written consent."" So you cannot use unless you have consent. Clause 2: ""Either party may use... without prior written consent."" Hmm, that would mean they can use even without consent. That seems contradictory. But wait, in legal terms, sometimes the wording is precise.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me parse it more carefully. Clause 1 uses ""shall not,"" so it's a strong prohibition. Clause 2 uses ""may,"" which is permissive. So if you can use without prior consent under Clause 2, then they are different because one restricts and the other allows.

But wait, perhaps the wording in Clause 2 is that either party may use their name without needing to get prior written consent from the other party? Or does it mean they can do so regardless of consent?

Wait, no, the wording is ""without the prior written consent,"" which could imply that you don't need it. But actually, in legal terms, if something requires prior consent, then doing it without would be against the clause.

But in Clause 2, it's phrased as ""may use... without the prior written consent."" So does that mean they can do it without needing to obtain consent first? Or is it saying they can't do it unless they have obtained prior consent?

I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure.

In Clause 1: Use is prohibited unless there's prior written consent. So if you want to use, you need to get consent first.

In Clause 2: It says either party may use... without prior written consent. So they can use regardless of whether they have consent or not. That would mean that the restriction in Clause 1 is lifted in Clause 2, making them different because one restricts and the other allows.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me look at the exact wording again.

Clause 1: ""Neither party... shall use... without prior written consent of such party."" So you cannot use unless you have their permission.

Clause 2: ""Either party... may use... without prior written consent..."" Which would mean they can use even if they don't have prior consent. That seems to allow the use, which is different from Clause 1's prohibition.

So yes, they are different because one restricts and the other allows.

Clause 1 says: ""Neither party to this Agreement shall use the name of any other party hereto or the name of any of the other party’s employee without the prior written consent of such party."" It repeats itself, which makes me think it's emphasizing the point. So, if I break it down, it's saying that both parties can't use each other's names or their employees' names without written permission.

Clause 2 is titled ""Name Usage Restrictions"" and states: ""No party involved in this Agreement is permitted to utilize the name of another party or the name of the other party's employees without first obtaining written approval from that party."" Here, it uses slightly different wording but seems to convey the same idea. Instead of using ""use"" or ""utilize,"" they say ""is permitted to utilize."" It also starts with ""No party"" instead of ""Neither party.""

I need to check if the key elements are the same. Both clauses talk about using another's name, whether it's the other party's name or their employees'. They both require prior written consent before doing so. The structure is a bit different—Clause 1 uses ""shall not use"" while Clause 2 says ""is permitted to utilize without first obtaining."" But the main point is that without written consent, using these names isn't allowed.

I should consider if there's any ambiguity or difference in how they're phrased. The word choices are a bit different (""utilize"" vs. ""use""), but they mean the same thing in this context. Both also specify the necessity of prior written consent from the party involved. So, even though the structure and some verbs differ, the core restriction is identical.

Therefore, I think both clauses have the same meaning because they both prohibit the use of another's name or their employees' names without prior consent.

Clause 1 is titled ""Use of Name"" and it states that neither party can use the other's name or their employees' names without prior written consent. The wording here is clear: both parties are restricted from using each other's names unless they get written permission first. So, it's a prohibition on either side using the other's name without consent.

Clause 2 also has the same title but says that either party may use the other's name or their employees' names without prior written consent. That means there's no restriction here; both parties are allowed to use each other's names freely without needing permission first.

Comparing these, Clause 1 restricts usage requiring consent, while Clause 2 allows usage without any need for consent. The key difference is in the verbs used: ""shall not"" versus ""may"". This changes the entire meaning of the clauses. One imposes a requirement to get permission, and the other removes that requirement.

So, they are definitely different because one enforces a restriction and the other doesn't. Therefore, the answer should be ""Different"".

Clause 2 is titled ""Name Usage Restrictions"" and states that no party can use another's name or their employees' names without first getting written approval. 

At first glance, they seem similar because both are about not using someone else's name without permission. But let me break down the details.

Clause 1 mentions ""the other party hereto"" and ""the name of any of the other party’s employee."" It also repeats the same sentence twice. Clause 2 uses ""another party or the name of the other party' employees"" and says ""without first obtaining written approval.""

I notice that both clauses prohibit using names without consent, but I should check if there are any subtle differences in wording that might change the meaning.

Clause 1 specifies ""the other party hereto,"" which refers to the parties involved in the agreement. Clause 2 uses ""another party"" and refers to employees as ""employees."" The structures are slightly different, but the intent seems the same—prohibiting unauthorized use of names.

The repetition in Clause 1 might be for emphasis, but it doesn't add any new information. Both clauses require written consent before using a name, whether that's another party or an employee.

I don't see any differences in the restrictions they impose. They both make it clear that prior written permission is necessary. So, despite minor wording variations, their meanings are identical.

Clause 2 says exactly what Clause 1 does. It prohibits the use of the Bank's name and allows their business name under the same condition.

They mention that this access is only limited to the Bank's name, related marks, logos, etc. But they also say that the business name can be used in a specific sense, like the nominative sense of the bank, within any credit disclosure in their ads or promotions.

Clause 2 starts with ""Consent Requirement for Use of Bank's Name"" and then says, ""Retailer is prohibited from utilizing the name... unless prior written approval. Such approval won't be unreasonably withheld or delayed."" However, they allow using the bank's business name nominatively in credit disclosure language in their ads or promotions.

Comparing both clauses, the main points are about consent and usage of the Bank's name. The only difference seems to be that one starts with ""Without prior written consent"" and the other says ""Retailer is prohibited from utilizing the name..."" So the structure is similar, but maybe they mean the same thing in terms of prohibition.

Wait, actually, Clause 2 doesn't use ""consent,"" it uses ""prohibited."" But both clauses limit usage to prior written consent or specific business use.

First off, both clauses are labeled as (b), which probably refers to a specific subsection in a larger document, like a contract or agreement. That's a good starting point because they're both part of the same section. Sometimes, even if two clauses are numbered the same, their content might vary, but here, they seem identical at first glance.

Looking closely at Clause 1 and Clause 2:

Clause 1 starts with ""Without the prior written consent of Bank..."" and goes on to say that Retailer may not use Bank's name or related marks without consent. It also mentions that Retailer may use Bank’s business name in a nominative sense in connection with credit disclosure verbiage in their advertising.

Clause 2 is exactly the same wording: it starts the same, lists the restrictions, and then provides the exception for using the business name in advertising. Even the structure of the sentences is identical, right down to the punctuation and the phrases used.

I'm trying to think if there's any possible difference here. Maybe a slight variation in wording? Let me check each part again:

- Both clauses start with ""Without the prior written consent...""
- The restriction on using Bank’s name or related marks is identical.
- The exception about using the business name in credit disclosure verbiage is word-for-word the same.

So, unless there's some hidden difference that's not immediately obvious, like a missing word or a change in prepositions, these clauses are the same. I don't see any variations in the conditions or exceptions. Even the legal jargon used matches exactly.

I guess it's possible that sometimes clauses might have different implications based on the context or other parts of the document, but strictly speaking, when comparing just the text here, they are identical. There’s no indication that one is a revised version of the other or that there's an alternative phrasing being used.

Therefore, after going through each part carefully and ensuring I'm not missing any nuances, I can confidently say that both clauses have the same meaning.

Okay, so I have these two legal clauses here, and I need to figure out if they mean the same thing or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Without the prior written consent of Bank..."" So it's saying that Retailer can't use Bank's name or any related marks unless they get permission first. But there's an exception: Retailer can use the business name nominatively in credit disclosure verbiage, like in advertising about the Program.

Clause 2 starts with ""Retailer is prohibited from utilizing..."" So it's similar but phrased differently. It says Retailer can't use Bank's name or any associated trademarks without prior written approval, which won't be unreasonably denied. However, they are allowed to reference the business name nominatively in credit disclosure language within their ads related to the Program.

Hmm, both clauses are restricting Retailer from using Bank's name or marks without consent but allow a specific use case for the business name in credit disclosures. The structure is similar: starting with a prohibition unless prior consent is given. The exceptions are also worded similarly—allowing the business name in specific advertising contexts.

I think the key points here are that both clauses prohibit Retailer from using Bank's name or related marks without consent, and allow nominative use in credit-related ads. So they seem to be saying the same thing, just phrased differently. The main difference is in the wording of ""without prior written consent"" versus ""prior written approval,"" but that doesn't change the meaning. Both also mention that the consent won't be unreasonably withheld, though Clause 1 says it's not unreasonably delayed, which might be a nuance but probably isn't material.

So overall, I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 says: Without prior written consent from Bank, Retailer may not use Bank's name or any related marks/logos. But there's an exception where Retailer can use Bank's business name in a nominative sense for credit disclosures in their advertising.

Clause 2 is almost identical but the first part says Retailer ""may use"" instead of ""may not use"". That seems like a big difference. So Clause 1 prohibits usage without consent, while Clause 2 allows it? Or maybe I misread.

Wait, no. Let me check again. Clause 1 starts with Retailer may NOT use... unless the exception applies. Clause 2 says Retailer MAY use... but only under the same conditions as an exception. Wait, that's confusing because the initial permission is different.

Hmm, actually looking closely: Clause 1 allows usage in a specific case (credit disclosures), while generally prohibits it without consent. Clause 2 seems to state that Retailer may use Bank's name with prior consent or under the exception. So they're both allowing use only under certain conditions, but the initial wording is different.

Wait no, on closer look: Clause 1 says ""may not use"" except in one case. Clause 2 says ""may use"" but requires prior consent except for that same case. So the main difference is whether usage is prohibited unless allowed (Clause 1) or permitted only with consent or under exception (Clause 2). The effect might be similar, but the wording is different.

But actually, reading again: Clause 1 starts by saying Retailer may not use without consent, but then allows a specific case. Clause 2 says Retailer may use, which seems contradictory unless it's a typo. It could be that Clause 2 was meant to say ""may not use"" as in Clause 1. Or perhaps there's an inversion.

Wait, looking at the structure:

Clause 1: Without consent, Retailer may NOT use... EXCEPT for this specific case.

Clause 2: Without consent, Retailer MAY use... which doesn't make sense because it should be a restriction. So perhaps Clause 2 is a mistake or misstatement.

Alternatively, maybe both are allowing usage only under certain conditions, but the way they're phrased is different. But legally, these differences could have significant implications. If one prohibits and the other allows without consent, that's a big difference.

Wait no, actually, both start with ""Without prior written consent... Retailer may [not] use..."" So Clause 1 says Retailer may NOT use without consent, but can in one case. Clause 2 says Retailer MAY use without consent, which would be opposite. That seems contradictory and likely a typo, but assuming they're accurate, the meanings are different.

But perhaps I'm misreading. Let me look again:

Clause 1: ""Retailer may not use Bank’s name...; provided that Retailer may use...""

Clause 2: ""Retailer may use Bank’s name...; provided that Retailer may use..."" which is redundant because it's the same condition.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key difference is in Clause 1, Retailer is prohibited from using Bank's name without consent, except in a specific case. In Clause 2, it says Retailer MAY use Bank’s name with prior consent or under that exception. So both effectively require consent except for the same exception.

Wait, but the initial part: Clause 1 prohibits usage without consent, and allows it only under the exception. Clause 2 states that Retailer may use (without needing consent) in the exception case? No, actually, no—Clause 2 still requires prior written consent unless using in the exception.

Wait, let me parse the structure:

Clause 1: Without consent, Retailer may NOT do X; except Retailer MAY do Y.

Clause 2: Without consent, Retailer MAY do X; but then it says ""provided that Retailer may use..."" which is the same as Clause 1's exception.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me break down each clause:

Clause 1:
- Prohibition without consent: Retailer may not use Bank’s name or marks.
- Exception: Can use in a specific way (nominative sense) for credit disclosures.

Clause 2:
- Permission without consent? No, it says ""may use"" but requires prior written consent. Wait no:

Wait the structure is similar except Clause 1 starts with prohibition and allows exception, while Clause 2 starts by allowing under certain conditions.

Actually, reading them again:

Clause 1: Retailer may not use Bank’s name without consent; provided that in one case they can.

Clause 2: Retailer may use Bank's name without consent? Or does it still require consent except for the same exception?

Wait no. Both start with ""Without prior written consent of Bank..."". Then Clause 1 says Retailer may NOT do X, while Clause 2 says Retailer MAY do X. So in effect:

Clause 1: Without consent, Retailer cannot use.

Clause 2: Without consent, Retailer can use? That seems contradictory.

Wait that can't be right because both are about requiring consent except for a specific case. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me look at them side by side.

Clause 1:
(b) Without prior consent, Retailer may not use Bank’s name or marks; provided they can use in a specific way.

Clause 2:
(b) Without prior consent, Retailer may use Bank’s name or marks; provided they can use in the same specific way.

Wait that would mean Clause 1 prohibits without exception except for a case, while Clause 2 allows usage without needing consent except... but that doesn't make sense because both are about requiring consent. It's likely a typo in Clause 2 where it should say ""may not use"" as in Clause 1.

Assuming they're accurate as written, the meanings are opposite: one prohibits, the other allows without consent, which would be different.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 says that Retailer cannot use Bank's name or related marks without prior written consent, which can't be unreasonably withheld. But they can use the Bank’s business name in a nominative sense for credit disclosure in their Program ads or promotions.

Clause 2 states that Retailer is prohibited from using Bank's name or affiliates' names and trademarks without prior written approval, which won't be unreasonably denied. However, they can use the Bank’s business name nominatively in credit disclosures within ads related to the Program or its promotions.

Comparing both, they both require prior written consent for using the Bank's name, with similar conditions on not unreasonable withholding/delaying of that consent. Both allow using the name in a nominative sense specifically for credit disclosure in advertising related to the Program and any credit-based promotions.

So, the main points are identical: restriction without consent, exception for nominative use in credit disclosures. The wording is slightly different but conveys the same meaning.

Okay, I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says that neither Panasonic nor Tesla will issue any press release, etc., as long as they get written permission from the other party before anything happens. It uses ""will not"" which is a present tense action verb, so it's like an obligation to comply.

Clause 2 states the same thing but without using ""will not."" So instead of saying they cannot do something without prior written approval because they have to fulfill their obligations (which would be the future tense with ""shall""), Clause 2 just says they may issue them under the same conditions. 

I think in English, ""may"" and ""will not"" can sometimes be used interchangeably for past tense actions where the obligation is now being fulfilled. However, using ""may"" here might imply that they have a right to do it without any obligations, which isn't quite accurate because the clauses specify that prior written approval is required.

So even though both clauses describe the same legal requirement about needing written permission before engagement or disclosure, one uses past tense and the other doesn't. That makes me lean towards them being considered different in meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1: It says that Panasonic and Tesla won't issue any press releases or public disclosure related to their relationship or terms unless they get written permission from each other before. That part seems pretty direct.

Clause 2: The wording is a bit longer, but it's mostly the same as Clause 1. ""No release... referencing their relationship..."" and ""without obtaining prior written consent."" So both are saying the same thing, just with slightly different phrasing.

I don't see any differences in meaning here. Both clauses require formal written approval before any public communication. The difference is just in how it's worded—maybe using ""without"" instead of ""without obtaining written consent,"" but that doesn't change much. So I think they are the same.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or are different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that Panasonic and Tesla will not issue any press releases, ads, etc., related to their relationship or the agreement terms without prior written approval from the other party.

Clause 2 allows them to issue such materials as long as they don't need prior approval. It actually uses ""may"" instead of ""will not,"" which seems like a significant difference in wording.

Wait, so Clause 1 is about禁止 issuing public statements without approval, while Clause 2 allows it but also doesn't require approval? Or does it mean they can do it without needing to ask?

Hmm, maybe the key is that Clause 1 prohibits them from doing anything without prior approval, whereas Clause 2 gives them permission to issue such materials as long as they don't have to get prior written consent. So they are opposites in terms of permission.

So, if I break it down:

Clause 1: No press releases unless both parties approve.
Clause 2: They can issue press releases without needing approval from the other party.

That makes them different because one prohibits unapproved statements and the other allows them with or without approval. Wait, no, in Clause 2, does ""without prior written approval"" mean that they can do it on their own? Or is it that they have permission but need to inform the other party?

Wait, actually, in legal terms, if something says ""may issue... without prior written approval,"" it could mean they are allowed to do so regardless of the other party's stance. So, in Clause 2, they have the freedom to issue those statements, whereas Clause 1 restricts them unless approved.

Therefore, Clauses 1 and 2 are opposites—Clause 1 prohibits without approval, while Clause 2 allows with or without. Hence, their meanings are different.

Clause 1 says that Panasonic and Tesla will not issue any press release, advertising, etc., that refers to their relationship or the terms without prior written approval from the other party. It's a bit formal in structure but seems straightforward.

Clause 2 is similar: Neither Panasonic nor Tesla shall release statements or advertisements referring to their relationship or the terms without obtaining prior written consent from the other party. It uses slightly different wording but seems to convey the same restriction.

I notice that both clauses use similar verbs like ""issue,"" ""release,"" and ""participate."" They also mention the same elements: press releases, advertising, public announcements, and reference to their relationship or terms without prior written consent. The only difference is in the structure of the sentence, but I don't see any substantial meaning differences.

So, I think both clauses are saying the same thing just phrased differently. Therefore, they have the same meaning.

Clause 1 says that Panasonic and Tesla will not issue any press release, advertising, etc., about their relationship or the agreement without prior written approval from each other. So this is a restriction—they can't do it unless both agree.

Clause 2 states that they may issue such materials without needing the prior written approval of the other party. That means they have permission to go ahead on their own, which is the opposite of Clause 1.

Comparing them, one prohibits action without approval, and the other allows it without needing approval. So they're definitely different.

Clause 1 says that Panasonic and Tesla won't issue any press release, advertising, publicity, or public statement. They also can't engage in any other form of public disclosure that refers to their relationship or relates to the terms of the agreement without prior written approval from the other party.

Clause 2 states that neither company will release press statements, advertisements, or public announcements. Also, they won't participate in any public disclosure about their relationship or the agreement's terms without getting prior written consent from each other.

Hmm, both clauses are about not making public statements related to their partnership or the agreement without approval. The wording is slightly different—Clause 1 uses ""issue"" while Clause 2 uses ""release."" But they both include press releases, ads, and similar things. Also, both require prior written consent/approval.

I don't see any differences in what's being restricted. They both cover the same types of public disclosures and the requirement for mutual approval before making any statements.

deepseek-r1:1.5b,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""In addition, upon written approval of BUYER..."" and then says ""SUPPLIER may use such trademarks and trade name in materials used in presentations made to suppliers of Components."" It goes on to say that any other provisions of this Agreement besides what's already mentioned won't grant SUPPLIER the right to use the trademarks or names as described. Then it adds, ""Suppliers will have no right..."" which seems like a restatement.

Clause 2 is almost identical: ""In addition, upon written approval..."", then the same point about using the trademarks and names for components presentation materials. It goes on similarly, except for the last part where it ends with ""...without the prior written approval of BUYER."" That's interesting—both clauses have the same ending.

Wait a minute, clause 2 uses ""will have no right to use"" instead of ""no right to use without."" I'm trying to remember if in some cases these can be considered equivalent. In common law, sometimes ""without"" is used more informally, but in criminal procedure and civil law, the phrasing with ""without"" might make it different because of the context.

In this case, both clauses are about SUPPLIER having no right to use the trademarks directly or indirectly in connection with product promotion or publication. The main difference seems to be in the ending of clause 2, where it says ""without the prior written approval of BUYER."" That's a bit stronger and more formal. But wait, I think in many jurisdictions, especially when dealing with company agreements that specify their obligations, using ""without"" is standard. It implies that BUYER must have written consent before anything is done.

Clauses 1 and 2 are almost the same except for this subtle ending. So, does that make them different? Or is it just a minor wording difference?

I'm not sure if in practice, these differences matter much because they're both making the same conditional clause. But to be safe, I should consider if ""without"" has any special meaning here. In the context of company agreements and prior written consent, using ""without"" can sometimes signal that it's a formal or procedural right rather than just an intent to use without permission.

Wait, maybe in some cases, like when making a promise about something not happening unless certain conditions are met, having ""without"" might make it clearer. So perhaps the endings are slightly different and would be considered distinct in terms of their content.

I'm a bit torn here because I think both clauses are essentially saying that SUPPLIER can't use those trademarks without BUYER's written approval beyond what's already stated. The only difference is in clause 2, which ends with ""without the prior written approval,"" while clause 1 just repeats the same sentence as an introductory part.

So, does this end part make a significant difference? Maybe yes. It uses ""without"" instead of repeating it at the beginning, but I'm not entirely sure if that's what would make them different in terms of meaning or not. Alternatively, perhaps they're considered interchangeable because they both convey the same information about prior written consent.

I think I'll go with ""Same"" for these two clauses because the main content is identical except for minor wording changes, which probably don't alter their meaning significantly.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through each carefully.

Clause 1: It says that the SUPPLIER can use their trademarks and names in materials for presentations given to components suppliers as long as they get written approval from BUYER. Then, even if there are other provisions in the Agreement, SUPPLIER won't have a right to use those trademarks or names directly or indirectly without prior BUYER's written consent.

Clause 2: It starts similarly—suppliers must agree with BUYER to incorporate the trademarks and names into component presentations. It also states that regardless of any other terms, they can't use them for products, promotions, or publications without BUYER's written permission.

Looking at both clauses, they seem to have similar points but maybe phrased differently. Clause 1 mentions ""may use such trademarks and trade name"" while Clause 2 says ""with the written consent of BUYER."" It seems like both are emphasizing that BUYER needs explicit permission before using their brand names or trademarks.

The main differences I see might be in word choice: one uses ""may use,"" the other uses ""with the written consent of."" But otherwise, they're structurally very similar. I don't think there's any nuance beyond that. So, probably they are the same meaning.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me read through both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by saying that upon written approval from the BUYER, the SUPPLIER may use the trademarks and trade names in materials presented to suppliers of Components. It also mentions that despite other parts of the agreement, the SUPPLIER won't have any right to use the BUYER's trademarks, trade names, or Product(s) names without prior written approval.

Clause 2 has a similar start: upon written approval from the BUYER, the SUPPLIER may use the trademarks and trade name in presentations. However, the key difference is in the second part. Clause 1 says that the SUPPLIER will have ""no right"" to use those elements without approval, whereas Clause 2 states that the SUPPLIER ""will have the right"" to use them with or without prior approval? Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misread that.

Wait, let me read again. Clause 1: Any other provisions notwithstanding, SUPPLIER will have no right to use the trademarks etc. directly or indirectly without prior written approval. So it's saying they can't use them unless specifically approved.

Clause 2: Similarly starts with the same, but then says ""SUPPLIER will have the right to use... without the prior written approval of BUYER."" Wait, that seems contradictory. Is it saying they have the right without needing approval? That would mean the first part about needing approval is being changed.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse it again.

Clause 1: SUPPLIER may use trademarks upon written approval, but cannot use them otherwise without prior approval.

Clause 2: SUPPLIER may use trademarks upon written approval, and they have the right to use them (without the need for prior approval). Wait, that seems conflicting because the first part allows only with approval, but the second says they can do it regardless. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, Clause 2's wording is: ""will have the right to use... without the prior written approval of BUYER."" So does that mean they can use them even without approval? That would contradict the initial part where they need approval. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and meant to say 'with' prior approval.

Alternatively, perhaps Clause 2 is more permissive than Clause 1, allowing usage without prior approval, which would make them different.

Wait, no, the structure of both clauses seems similar. Let me check again.

Clause 1: Upon approval, may use in presentations; any other provision notwithstanding, SUPPLIER has no right to use the trademarks etc. directly or indirectly without prior approval.

Clause 2: Upon approval, may use in presentations; any other provisions notwithstanding, SUPPLIER will have the right to use the trademarks etc. directly or indirectly without the prior written approval of BUYER.

So in Clause 1, it's clear that without prior approval, they can't use them. In Clause 2, it says they have the right to do so without prior approval. So that seems different because one requires approval and the other allows usage without.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misreading. Maybe in Clause 2, ""without the prior written approval"" is a mistake, and it's supposed to be with. Alternatively, maybe it's intentionally contrasting.

Alternatively, perhaps both clauses are allowing use only upon approval, but Clause 2 adds something else. Hmm, no, because in Clause 1, they can't use without approval, while in Clause 2, they have the right to use without approval, which would mean they can do so even if not approved, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the exact wording again.

Clause 1: ""...SUPPLIER will have no right to use... without the prior written approval of BUYER.""

Clause 2: ""...SUPPLIER will have the right to use... without the prior written approval of BUYER.""

So in Clause 1, they can't do it without approval. In Clause 2, they can do it with or without? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be 'with' prior.

Alternatively, perhaps the wording is that in Clause 1, they need approval to use them, whereas in Clause 2, they have the right regardless of approval, which would make them different because one requires permission and the other doesn't.

Wait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again.

Clause 1: Upon written approval, may use. Any other provisions notwithstanding, SUPPLIER has no right to use... without prior approval.

So that means even if there are other clauses, they still can't use without approval.

Clause 2: Similarly, upon written approval, may use. But any other provisions notwithstanding, SUPPLIER will have the right to use... without prior approval.

Wait, so in Clause 1, it's a prohibition without approval, whereas in Clause 2, it's allowing usage without approval.

That would mean that in one clause, you can't do it unless approved, and in the other, you can do it even if not approved. So they are different because one restricts usage to with approval, and the other allows usage regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the second clause is more lenient towards usage without prior approval, making them different.

Yes, that seems to be the case. So Clauses 1 and 2 have different implications regarding the need for prior written approval.

Okay, so I need to figure out if Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts by saying that upon written approval from the Buyer, the Supplier may use trademarks and trade names in materials presented to suppliers of Components. It also mentions that even if there are other provisions in the agreement, the Supplier can't use the Buyer's trademarks, etc., without prior written approval.

Clause 2 is similar but worded slightly differently. It says the Supplier is permitted with the Buyer's written consent to incorporate such trademarks in materials for presentations to suppliers of Components. Then it states that regardless of other terms, the Supplier is prohibited from using the Buyer's trademarks either directly or indirectly for any product, promotional activity, or publication without prior written permission.

I notice both clauses allow the Supplier to use trademarks with the Buyer's approval when presenting to Component suppliers. However, Clause 1 uses ""materials used in presentations made to suppliers of Components,"" while Clause 2 specifies ""materials for presentations to suppliers of Components.""

The main difference seems to be in how they phrase the restriction after allowing the use. Clause 1 says that despite other provisions, the Supplier can't use the Buyer's trademarks without prior approval. Clause 2 explicitly states that the Supplier is prohibited from using them directly or indirectly for any product, promotion, or publication without prior written consent.

Hmm, are these restrictions the same? The key point is whether ""directly or indirectly"" in Clause 2 broadens the restriction beyond just presentations to Component suppliers. In Clause 1, it seems like the only restriction is on using the trademarks directly or indirectly for products, promotions, or publications without prior approval, which might include more uses than just presentations.

Wait, but both clauses have a similar structure: allow usage with approval and prohibit without it. The wording in Clause 2 adds ""directly or indirectly,"" making it potentially broader. However, in the first part, both allow using in presentations to Component suppliers upon approval. So maybe they are intended to mean the same thing.

But I'm not entirely sure because of the difference in phrasing regarding indirect use. Maybe one is more restrictive than the other.

Clause 1 says that upon written approval from the BUYER, the SUPPLIER can use certain trademarks and trade names in materials used for presentations to suppliers of Components. It then adds that regardless of other provisions in the Agreement, the SUPPLIER doesn't have any right to use these trademarks or product names in connection with any products, promotions, or publications without prior written approval from BUYER.

Clause 2 also mentions that upon written approval, the SUPPLIER can use the trademarks and trade names in materials for presentations. However, it then states that the SUPPLIER does have the right to use these marks directly or indirectly in connection with products, promotions, or publications without needing prior written approval from BUYER.

Wait, so in Clause 1, the second part says the SUPPLIER has no right without approval, but in Clause 2, it's the opposite—they do have that right. That seems contradictory. Let me make sure I'm not misreading anything.

Clause 1: ""SUPPLIER will have no right to use..."" vs. Clause 2: ""SUPPLIER will have the right to use..."". Yes, that's a clear difference. So one restricts usage without approval, and the other allows it without needing approval.

Therefore, these clauses are conveying opposite permissions regarding the use of trademarks beyond presentations.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 says that with the buyer's written approval, the supplier can use their trademarks and trade names in materials for presentations to component suppliers. But it also states that regardless of other parts of the agreement, the supplier has no right to use these marks directly or indirectly for any products, promotions, or publications without prior written approval.

Clause 2 is similar: with written consent, the supplier can incorporate the trademarks and trade names in materials for presentations to component suppliers. However, it also says that regardless of other terms, the supplier is prohibited from using the buyer's marks, whether directly or indirectly, for any product, promotional activity, or publication without first getting prior written permission.

Looking at both clauses, they both require written approval from the buyer for the supplier to use trademarks and trade names in specific presentations. Both also restrict the supplier from using these marks elsewhere without explicit permission, emphasizing that this restriction stands even if other parts of the agreement might suggest otherwise.

The wording is slightly different—""use such trademarks"" vs. ""incorporate such trademarks""—but the meaning seems identical. The key points are about when usage is allowed (presentations to component suppliers with approval) and when it's prohibited (other uses without prior permission). Both clauses emphasize that this rule overrides any other provisions in the agreement.

I don't see any differences in the permissions or restrictions outlined; both grant limited use with consent and forbid broader use without it. Therefore, they appear to have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 has several sections. The first one talks about releasing information from a Subcontractor without certain approvals. It says the Seller shouldn't publish any info developed under this Subcontract and can't disclose details about the existence or subject matter of this Subcontract, nor use the Buyer's name in sales promotion without prior written approval.

Clause 2 is similar, but it uses ""may"" instead of ""shall."" So instead of saying the Seller must not do something, it says they may. But then in the second part, it changes from ""will be subject to"" to ""will not be subject to."" That's a big difference because one says it should go through review and approval, while the other says it shouldn't.

So, comparing both clauses, even though they use similar language except for the first part, there are differences in how they handle the publication of information. The key change is that Clause 2 changes ""will be subject to"" to ""will not be."" That's a critical difference because it affects what's allowed and what's prohibited.

I think these clauses are different because one uses ""shall"" (which means must) and the other says ""may,"" which means might. Also, in one clause they allow certain actions, while the other prohibits them. The main point is about the conditions for releasing information, so they're not the same.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Looking at Clause 1, it has two parts: Release of Information and publicity. The first part is pretty long with several prohibitions on what can't be published. Then there's ""Publicity 10."" The second part lists some details about how information becomes public, including the need for written approval from the buyer before anything else.

Clause 2 also has two parts: Release of Information and publicity. It starts by saying the Seller is prohibited from publishing data generated through the Subcontract. Then it says not to reveal, verify, or refute info about existence or specifics. After that, it mentions using the Buyer's name in promotional activities without prior written consent.

Wait, so Clause 1 has two main parts: one for Release of Information and another for Publicity 10. Clause 2 is structured similarly but maybe with a slight shift in wording. Let me compare each part.

First, both clauses mention that Release of Information is prohibited. The first clause says it's not allowed to publish anything developed under the Subcontract or deal with details about existence or subject matter. The second clause uses ""data generated through this Subcontract,"" which might seem a bit different in wording but essentially covering the same thing.

Next, both clauses talk about Publicity 10 (which I think is a reference to an existing law). Clause 1 says it's subject to good faith review and prior written approval. Clause 2 also states that before any dissemination, the Subcontractor must obtain the Prime Contractor's consent after reviewing any intended material.

Hmm, so both clauses address the same prohibited actions but with different wording in their second part. Does ""publicity"" vs. ""public disclosure""? I think ""publicity"" is more commonly used than ""public disclosure."" Also, the terminology about the process of getting written approval seems similar, though not exactly the same.

Wait, the first clause's first part is repetitive for Release and Publicity 10, while the second clause repeats Release but then shifts to a different word. Maybe it's just wording differences. I think the core content is the same, so they should be considered the same under law.

Okay, so I have to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Release Of Information Seller shall not..."" and goes on about not publishing information without Buyer's approval. Then there's PUBLICITY 10.1 stating that any publicity by the Subcontractor needs Prime Contractor's written approval before release.

Clause 2 also begins similarly: ""Release Of Information Seller may publish..."" again talking about not needing prior approval, but then in the PUBLICITY section, it says ""will not be subject to..."" meaning the Prime Contractor doesn't need to approve before release. 

Wait, so Clause 1 requires Buyer's approval for publication and also requires Prime Contractor's review and approval before releasing any publicity. Clause 2 allows Seller to publish info without prior approval but then says that PUBLICITY 10.1 doesn't require Prime Contractor's approval—meaning the Subcontractor can do it on their own.

Hmm, so in Clause 1, both the publication and the publicity are restricted with approvals. In Clause 2, publication is allowed without approval, but the publicity part is now unrestricted because the second part says ""will not be subject to"" meaning no need for Prime Contractor's okay. So they're actually conflicting in their requirements regarding publicity.

Therefore, they seem different because one restricts both while the other allows some parts without restrictions.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 is labeled ""Release Of Information Seller"" and it says that the Seller shouldn't publish any info from the Subcontract, shouldn't disclose, confirm, or deny details about the Subcontract, and can't use the Buyer's name in sales promotions without prior written approval. It repeats this exact statement twice, which might be a typo, but the meaning is clear.

Clause 2 starts with ""Release of Information"" as well. It says the Seller is prohibited from publishing data generated through the Subcontract. They also can't reveal or refute any info about the existence or specifics of the Subcontract and must not use the Buyer's name in promotional activities without consent.

Comparing both clauses, they both talk about the Seller not being able to publish or disclose information about the Subcontract, nor use the Buyer's name without approval. The wording is slightly different but the intent seems the same: restrict the Seller from sharing info and require prior written consent.

In Clause 1, it mentions ""developed under this Subcontract"" while Clause 2 uses ""generated through this Subcontract."" That's a minor difference in wording but doesn't change the meaning. Also, both clauses have a part about using the Buyer's name in publicity or sales promotions without approval, which is identical.

Clause 1 has two identical paragraphs, likely a duplication, whereas Clause 2 combines these points more succinctly. However, the core restrictions are the same: no disclosure of Subcontract info and no use of the Buyer's name without written consent.

So, even though the wording isn't identical, the meaning is consistent between both clauses.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1: It starts with ""Release Of Information"" where the Seller shall NOT publish information developed under the Subcontract, nor disclose details about its existence without prior written approval from the Buyer. There's also a part about not using the Buyer’s name for sales promotion without permission. Then in PUBLICITY 10.1, any news release by the Subcontractor concerning the Program or related contracts must go through Prime Contractor's review and approval.

Clause 2: The ""Release Of Information"" here says Seller MAY publish information developed under this Subcontract, disclose details about its existence, etc., without prior written approval from the Buyer. So it's allowing the Seller to do these things freely. Then in PUBLICITY 10.1, any proposed publicity by the Subcontractor doesn't need Prime Contractor’s review and approval before release.

Comparing both clauses: In Clause 1, the restrictions are clear—Seller needs permission for information release and cannot use Buyer's name without consent. Also, Subcontractor's public statements must be approved by Prime Contractor.

In Clause 2, the restrictions are lifted—Seller can publish and disclose without approval, and the Subcontractor doesn't need to get approval from the Prime Contractor.

So clearly, the permissions in both clauses are opposite regarding releasing information and seeking approvals. Therefore, they have different meanings.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 has two sections: ""Release Of Information"" and ""Publicity"". In the first part, it says that the Seller can't publish any information from this Subcontract, disclose details about its existence or subject matter, or use the Buyer's name in promotions without written approval. Then under Publicity, section 10.1 states that any news releases or other promotional materials by the Subcontractor about the Program, their efforts on the Proposal, or resulting contracts must be reviewed and approved in good faith by the Prime Contractor before being released.

Clause 2 also has two sections: ""Release of Information"" and ""Publicity"". The first part mirrors Clause 1 exactly, stating the Seller can't publish data from the Subcontract, reveal details about its existence or specifics, or use the Buyer's name without written consent. Under Publicity, section 10.1 is almost identical to Clause 1's Publicity section, mentioning the same points but phrased slightly differently—like ""sincere review"" instead of ""good faith review"".

Now, comparing both clauses side by side, they cover the same topics with very similar language and requirements. The only minor difference is in the wording like ""sincere review"" vs. ""good faith review"", but that doesn't change the meaning; it's just a variation in phrasing. Everything else lines up exactly.

So, I think both clauses are conveying the same restrictions on information release and publicity, just written slightly differently.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 seems to repeat a lot of the same phrases about not using the company's name for advertising and using it when necessary. It also mentions that the supplier can't use their marks unless they get written approval first, and then they can use them on the company's marketing materials. 

Clause 2 is similar but uses ""may"" instead of ""shall."" So, like, in Clause 1, it says ""supplier shall not refer..."" which sounds more formal or authoritative. In Clause 2, it says ""Supplier may refer..."", which is a bit more permissive.

I think the main difference is the use of ""shall"" versus ""may."" In some legal contexts, ""shall"" means must be done by law and can't be used just because someone's word. But in others, it might mean is permissible under specific circumstances. Also, the structure is a bit different; Clause 1 uses ""shall not refer,"" while Clause 2 says ""may refer.""

So, considering these points, I think they are different in meaning. One is stricter in enforcing rules, and the other is more flexible.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 looks a bit repetitive in some parts. It repeats ""Supplier shall not refer to Company..."" twice, then later ""Company may use Supplier’s name..."" and another repetition at the end. That seems odd because having repeated statements might be redundant, which could make it look like a mistake rather than an accurate legal document.

Clause 2 is structured differently. It starts with ""The Supplier must obtain prior written consent from the Company before mentioning the Company..."" which is shorter but covers the same point as in Clause 1. Then it continues with the prohibited actions for using the company's names and symbols, and ends by saying the Company is authorized to use the supplier's name.

So, comparing both, they do have similar content but with slight differences in wording and repetition. The main difference seems to be that Clause 2 starts without repeating the same statement again as in Clause 1. That makes me think they're slightly different because of how they phrase it or maybe a typo in repetition.

I wonder if the duplication in Clause 1 might make it seem like an error, while Clause 2 is more concise and avoids redundancy. Therefore, even though their content is mostly similar, the structure with repeated sentences might indicate that they are not exactly the same.

Clause 1 starts by saying that the Supplier cannot refer to the Company without prior written approval. It also says the Supplier can't use any of the Company's intellectual properties like name, logo, etc., without approval. Then, it allows the Company to use the Supplier's name and other IP in their marketing.

Clause 2 is almost identical but with a twist. It says the Supplier may refer to the Company without prior approval. Wait, that's the opposite of Clause 1. So in Clause 2, the Supplier can actually use the Company's name and other IPs without needing permission, while Clause 1 restricts them from doing so.

So, Clause 1 is restrictive about publicity and using IP, whereas Clause 2 permits it. This means they have different implications for the Supplier. Therefore, they are different.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""PUBLICITY; USE OF NAME AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY."" It says that the Supplier can't refer to the Company in any advertising or communications without prior written approval. It also prohibits using the Company's name, logos, trademarks, patents, copyrights, or trade dress without such approval. Then, it allows the Company to use the Supplier's intellectual property for their Merchandise marketing.

Clause 2 is titled ""PUBLICITY AND USE OF NAMES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY."" It states that the Supplier must get prior written consent from the Company before mentioning them in ads or materials. It also prohibits using the Company's trademarks and other IP without approval. Conversely, it allows the Company to use the Supplier's IP for their marketing.

Comparing both clauses, they both talk about the Supplier not using the Company's name or IP without permission. They both allow the Company to use the Supplier's IP. The structure is slightly different—Clause 1 starts with ""PUBLICITY"" and then goes into the use of names and IP, while Clause 2 combines the concepts in its title but covers similar points.

The main difference I notice is that in Clause 1, it explicitly says the Company may use the Supplier's intellectual property for their Merchandise marketing, while in Clause 2, it also allows this but maybe in a more general sense. However, both clauses seem to grant permission in one direction (Company to use Supplier's IP) and restrict the other direction (Supplier from using Company's IP without approval).

I don't see any significant differences in their prohibitions or permissions regarding the use of names and intellectual property. Both clauses enforce that the Supplier can't use Company's assets without consent and allow the Company to use the Supplier's assets for marketing.

Therefore, I think both clauses have the same meaning.

So, no ads or communications mentioning the Company unless they get permission first. Then it adds that the Supplier can't use the Company's name, logo, trademarks, etc., without approval either. But then it says the Company can use the Supplier's intellectual property for marketing merchandise.

Now, Clause 2 is similar but has some key differences. It starts by saying the Supplier may refer to the Company in advertising or communications without prior written approval. That's a big change from ""shall not"" to ""may"". Then it states that the Supplier may use the Company’s name and other IP without approval as well. So, this is allowing the Supplier more freedom compared to Clause 1.

The last part of both clauses is the same: the Company can use the Supplier's intellectual property for marketing. But the main difference lies in what the Supplier is allowed or not allowed to do regarding the Company's name and IP.

So, putting it all together, Clause 1 restricts the Supplier from using the Company’s information without approval, while Clause 2 allows the Supplier to do so without needing permission first. This makes them different clauses because they grant opposite permissions to the Supplier concerning the Company’s intellectual property.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether two legal clauses are the same or different. They've provided both clauses and asked for ""Same"" or ""Different"".

First, I'll read through each clause carefully to understand their contents.

Clause 1 starts by saying the parties must obtain prior consent from the other party before any disclosure occurs. It mentions promptly notifying in writing if they discover a breach of confidentiality. Also, it includes an option where they can comply with authorized disclosures as per law or court orders.

Clause 2 begins similarly but uses ""need not"" instead of ""obtain."" It emphasizes that there's no obligation to get consent unless required by law or court orders. Again, the notification about promptly notifying for unauthorized disclosure is present, and there's an option for compliance with authorized info as per law or court orders.

Comparing both clauses, the key differences are in the wording of ""obtain"" vs. ""need not,"" but the rest of the content seems identical. The requirements for notifications about unauthorized disclosure and the optional compliance part match up too.

So, they don't differ significantly; their main points are similar. Therefore, I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that the parties should obtain prior and express consent from each other for any reports or details about an object. They also have to notify the party who disclosed in writing before any disclosure is done by law or a court order, or if it's authorized, still need to give written notification. 

Clause 2 states that each party must secure explicit prior consent before sharing any related information. Then, if there's an authorized disclosure, the same notification process applies. It also mentions legal requirements or court directives necessitate immediate writing for notifications.

Hmm, both clauses talk about obtaining prior consent and then requiring a notification after. But wait, Clause 1 says ""prior and express consent,"" while Clause 2 just says ""explicit prior consent."" I think ""express"" might be more formal than ""explicit,"" but in legal terms, maybe it's the same thing.

Looking at what they both require: obtaining consent before any disclosure occurs or being notified promptly. The difference is in how they handle notifications after someone discloses. Clause 1 says to notify immediately if it's by law or a court order. Clause 2 states that if there's an authorization, the notification should apply the same protocol.

Wait, but both clauses require notifying in writing, either before any disclosure (Lawful or Court Order) or when authorized. So maybe they're similar. But I'm not sure if ""prior and express consent"" is a recognized term in legal documents. Maybe it's more formal than just ""explicit prior consent.""

Alternatively, perhaps ""express"" adds formality, making it clearer that the parties are directly asking for consent. But both seem to require notifications following disclosure.

So, putting it together: Both clauses require prior consent before any sharing and a prompt notification of discovery after law or court orders or authorization. The main difference is in using ""prior and express consent"" vs just ""explicit prior consent."" Since ""express"" might be more formal, but both are similar in intent.

I think they're still intended to mean the same thing. So the answer would be ""Same.""
</think>

The two clauses have the same meaning, with only a slight difference in terminology regarding the formality of prior consent. Both require parties to obtain explicit prior consent before sharing information and promptly notify in writing after it's discovered. Therefore, they are intended to mean the same thing.

Clause 1 starts by saying ""The parties shall obtain prior and express consent..."" So both parties must get explicit approval from each other before disclosing any reports, illustrations, etc., related to the object in question. They also have to notify the other party in writing before any disclosure due to law or court order. Additionally, if an authorized disclosure has already happened, they still need to handle it properly.

Clause 2 says ""The parties need not obtain prior and express consent..."" Wait, that's different. The word ""need"" here implies that obtaining consent is not necessary. So the first part of Clause 1 requires consent, while Clause 2 does not. 

Moving on, both clauses mention promptly notifying in writing the party revealed before any disclosure due to law or court order. That part seems identical.

Then there's the last part: ""Or still, in the event that it has occurred an authorized disclosure..."" Both clauses have this, but again, since Clause 1 starts with a requirement for prior consent, while Clause 2 says they need not do so, the initial parts are different.

So even though some parts of both clauses overlap, the first major difference is whether prior and express consent must be obtained. Since one requires it and the other doesn't, their meanings differ.
</think>

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's start by breaking down each clause.

Clause 1 talks about obtaining prior and express consent from the other party before disclosing any reports, illustrations, interviews, or details related to an object. It also mentions notifying the party in writing before any disclosure due to law or court order. Additionally, it refers to an event where there's been an authorized disclosure of confidential information.

Clause 2 is a bit longer but seems similar at first glance. It says that each party must secure explicit prior consent from the other before sharing reports and other information related to the subject matter. It also mentions that if disclosure is required by law or court directive, the responsible party must notify the other in writing promptly. Furthermore, it covers the scenario where a disclosure has been authorized, using the same notification protocol.

I'm noticing some key terms here: ""prior consent,"" ""promptly notify in writing,"" and handling authorized disclosures. Both clauses require prior consent before any disclosure, which is a strong indicator they might mean the same thing.

Looking deeper, Clause 1 uses ""express"" when talking about consent, while Clause 2 uses ""explicit."" That could be a difference. Express consent typically implies an explicit or clear statement of agreement, but both clauses are requiring some form of prior approval from the other party before sharing information. 

Also, both clauses mention notifying in writing if disclosure is required by law or court order. They both handle the situation where the disclosure has been authorized, though Clause 1 says ""in the event that it has occurred an authorized disclosure,"" while Clause 2 uses ""if a disclosure of such confidential information has been authorized."" 

The structure and purpose seem identical—both are about protecting confidentiality by requiring prior consent and notification. The slight difference in wording between ""express"" vs. ""explicit"" might be semantic but still, the requirements are essentially the same.

So, even though there's a variation in word choice, the core obligation of obtaining prior consent and notifying before disclosure is consistent across both clauses.

Clause 1 says: ""The parties shall obtain prior and express consent from the other party for the eventual disclosure..."" So it's stating that both parties must get each other's explicit permission before disclosing any reports, illustrations, etc., related to the object hereof. It also mentions promptly notifying in writing if there's a disclosure required by law or court order, or if an authorized disclosure has happened.

Clause 2 starts similarly but then changes up: ""The parties need not obtain prior and express consent..."" Wait, so this one is saying that they don't have to get the other party's explicit permission? That seems like a big difference. The rest of Clause 2 mirrors Clause 1 about notifying in writing before disclosure due to law or court order, or if an authorized disclosure occurs.

So the key difference here is whether consent is required (Clause 1) or not required (Clause 2). Therefore, these clauses are different because one enforces a requirement for consent while the other does not.

Hmm, both clauses talk about needing consent before disclosure and notifying the other party if they have to disclose because of law or court order. Both mention that even when an authorized disclosure happens, notification is required.

Clause 2 is a bit more straightforward, just saying ""Either Party may use..."" so it's giving an inclusive statement allowing either party to use their names under the same conditions as in Clause 1.

I think ""Neither"" implies that both parties don't have the right, while ""Either"" allows one or both. So they're not exactly the same because one is exclusive and the other is inclusive.

Clause 1 starts with ""23.

It also mentions customer lists, publicity releases, etc., and they have to comply with this restriction by obtaining written permission.

Clause 2 just says ""23: Utilization of Names and Marks."" It doesn't elaborate much beyond stating that no Party is permitted to incorporate another's name, etc., in any form of communication without explicit prior written approval from an authorized representative. So it seems like both clauses are talking about the same legal concept.

Wait, but clause 1 might have more specific details or exceptions mentioned earlier? I don't see that here. It just starts with ""USE OF NAME OR MARK"" and then goes into what can't be done. Clause 2 is a bit more general, just stating it without elaborating on the specifics beyond their restriction.

So both clauses are essentially saying the same thing: they prohibit the use of any party's name or mark in communications unless explicitly approved by an authorized representative. They might have some nuances in terms like who can use them or what kind of communications aren't allowed, but at a high level, they're the same law.

deepseek-r1:8b,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at Clause 1. It says that neither party can use the name, trade name, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, or logo of the other without express prior written consent from the other's duly authorized representative. So, it's a one-way restriction. Each party is prohibited from using the others' marks unless they get explicit permission in writing.

Now, looking at Clause 2. It starts with ""Either Party may use..."" which immediately changes my perception. The word ""may"" here suggests permission rather than prohibition. So, it's stating that either party can use the other's name or marks under certain conditions, specifically without prior written consent from the other's authorized representative.

Wait, but in Clause 1, it's a clear prohibition: neither party may use the others' marks without consent. In Clause 2, it flips the perspective. Instead of prohibiting, it allows either party to use the names or marks as long as they don't have prior written consent. Hmm, that seems contradictory because if ""may"" is used, then using without consent would be allowed, but in reality, you might still need permission.

But legally, the wording is crucial. In Clause 1, it's a negative: neither can do something unless with consent. In Clause 2, it's a positive: either may do something, but without prior written consent. So, does this mean they can use the marks even without consent? Or do they need to seek consent before using?

Wait, in Clause 1, ""shall"" means must not without consent. In Clause 2, ""may use...without express prior written consent."" So, perhaps it's allowing the use but only without prior consent, which might imply that if they want to use with consent, they can do so by seeking it.

But actually, no—Clause 1 says you cannot do it unless you have prior written consent. Clause 2 says you may do it, but without prior written consent. That seems conflicting because in one case, using without consent is prohibited, and in the other, using without consent is allowed. So they're effectively saying opposite things.

Wait no, that can't be right. Let me parse this again.

Clause 1: ""Neither Party shall use...without express prior written consent.""
So, if you don't have prior written consent, you cannot use them.

Clause 2: ""Either Party may use...without the express prior written consent...""
So, it's saying they can use without consent. That would mean that the parties are allowed to use each other's marks without permission, which contradicts Clause 1 where it was prohibited unless with consent.

But wait, in reality, both clauses might be referring to the same situation but phrased differently. Maybe one is a restriction and the other is permissive.

Alternatively, perhaps the key difference is that in Clause 2, ""Either Party may use"" implies that each party can use the others' names without prior consent, whereas Clause 1 prohibits this unless with prior written consent.

Wait, no—Clause 1 says you cannot use without prior consent. So using without prior consent is prohibited. In Clause 2, it's phrased as ""may use...without express prior written consent,"" which seems to allow the use even without consent.

So, they are opposites in effect. If a party wanted to use the other's mark without consent, Clause 1 prohibits it, while Clause 2 allows it.

Therefore, their meanings are different because one restricts without prior consent and the other permits without prior consent.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or are different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""USE OF NAME OR MARK"" and goes on to say that neither party can use the other's name, etc., without consent in various communications like customer lists, publicity releases, advertising, promotional materials, direct mail, seminars, websites, etc.

Clause 2 is titled ""23: Utilization of Names and Marks."" It states that no party is permitted to incorporate the other's name or marks in any form of communication—such as customer lists, press releases, ads, promotional content, direct mail, seminars, other formats—without explicit prior written approval from an authorized representative.

Looking at the wording, both clauses are about restrictions on using each other's names and marks. They both mention the same elements: no use without prior consent, which can be granted by a duly authorized or authorized representative, and they list similar communications as examples.

However, I notice some differences in wording. Clause 1 uses ""use of name or mark"" while Clause 2 starts with ""Utilization of Names and Marks."" The structure is slightly different but the meaning seems similar—they both prohibit the use without consent.

Also, both clauses mention the same list of communications: customer lists, publicity releases, advertising, promotional materials, direct mail, seminars, websites. So the examples are identical in both clauses.

The main difference might be in the exact wording of the prohibitions and the use of terms like ""express prior written consent"" versus ""explicit prior written approval."" However, these are minor variations that don't change the legal meaning significantly—they essentially convey the same restriction.

Therefore, I think both clauses have the same meaning because they prohibit the unauthorized use of the other party's names and marks in specified communications without prior consent from an authorized representative.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me take a closer look at each one step by step.

First, both clauses are titled ""23. USE OF NAME OR MARK,"" which suggests they're dealing with similar topics—using names, trademarks, etc., of the other party. But I need to see how they handle this usage.

Clause 1 says: Neither Party shall use... without express prior written consent. So that means both parties are restricted from using each other's names or marks unless they get written permission first. It uses ""shall not,"" which is a strong negative, indicating prohibition without consent.

Now, looking at Clause 2: Either Party may use... without the same written consent. Wait, actually no—it says ""without the express prior written consent."" Hmm, but wait, does it mean that either party can use it without needing consent? Or is it structured differently?

Wait, let me read it again more carefully.

Clause 1:
""Neither Party shall use... without the express prior written consent of the other’s duly authorized representative.""

So both parties cannot use each other's marks without permission. So they need to get consent first.

Clause 2:
""Either Party may use... without the express prior written consent of the other’s duly authorized representative.""

Wait, that can't be right because ""may use without"" would mean they don't need consent. But actually, reading it again: Clause 2 says Either Party may use... ""without the express prior written consent."" That sounds contradictory because if you don't need consent, then you can use it freely. So in Clause 1, you can't use without consent, but Clause 2 is saying either party can use without needing that consent.

Wait, maybe I misread the structure. Let me parse them:

Clause 1: Neither Party shall use... without [consent]. So using is prohibited unless they have consent.

Clause 2: Either Party may use... without [consent]. Wait, that would mean they can use it even without getting consent, which is different. But maybe I'm misinterpreting the wording.

Wait, perhaps in Clause 2, it's structured as ""Either Party may use... only with the express prior written consent."" Because often these clauses have exceptions where you need consent. So if Clause 2 says Either Party may use without, that would be a big difference. But perhaps I'm reading it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe both are saying they can't use without consent, but one uses ""Neither"" and the other uses ""Either.""

Wait, let me read them again carefully:

Clause 1: Neither Party shall use... without express prior written consent.

So that's a prohibition on both parties using each other's marks without permission. So you need permission to use.

Clause 2: Either Party may use... without express prior written consent.

This would mean either party can use the other's marks without needing permission, which is the opposite of Clause 1.

But that seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading because in legal clauses, ""shall"" and ""may"" have specific meanings. ""Shall"" indicates an obligation or prohibition, while ""may"" indicates a right or permission.

So in Clause 1: Neither Party shall use... without consent. So they are prohibited from using without consent.

Clause 2: Either Party may use... without consent. So they're allowed to use without needing consent.

Wait, that would mean the clauses are opposites. One says you can't do it without permission, and the other says you can do it without permission. That's a clear difference.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting because sometimes ""without"" is used differently. Let me check: in Clause 1, using requires prior consent. In Clause 2, using does not require prior consent because they may use without it. So yes, that would mean the clauses are opposites.

Wait, but perhaps the wording in Clause 2 is similar to Clause 1 but with a different structure. Let me see:

Clause 1: Neither Party shall use... without [consent].

Clause 2: Either Party may use... without [consent].

So in Clause 1, it's prohibited unless you have consent.

In Clause 2, it's allowed without needing consent.

Therefore, they are different because one requires permission and the other does not.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's take them one by one.

Clause 1 says that neither party can use the name, trade name, service marks, trademarks, etc., in customer lists, publicity releases, advertising, promotional materials, direct mail, seminars, on the other party’s website, or other communications without express prior written consent from an authorized representative. 

Clause 2 is structured similarly but uses slightly different wording. It mentions that no party can incorporate the other's name, trade name, service marks, etc., in any form of communication such as customer lists, press releases, advertisements, promotional content, direct mail, seminars, on the other's website, or other related formats without explicit prior written approval from an authorized representative.

Looking at both clauses, they cover the same elements: restriction on using names and marks, specific examples of where they can't be used (customer lists, publicity/press releases, ads, etc.), and the requirement for express/prior written consent. The wording is slightly different but conveys the same意思. So I think they mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Neither party shall use the name of the other party in any publicity, promotion or other written oral or electronic communication to third parties without the express written permission of the other party."" The key here is that it's saying neither party can use the other's name unless they give explicit written permission. So both parties have the same condition.

Clause 2 says: ""Either party shall use the name of the other party in any publicity, promotion or other written oral or electronic communication to third parties without the express written permission of the other party."" The difference here is that it's using ""either"" instead of ""neither."" But does this change anything? If both parties are allowed to use each other's names under these conditions, then even if they swap, both still have to comply. So essentially, both clauses require that neither can use the other's name without permission.

Wait, but maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. The word ""either"" might mean ""at least one,"" so does this affect the condition? If both parties need to follow the same rules, then changing it from ""neither"" to ""either"" would still require both conditions: each party must follow that they can't use without permission.

So if I have to evaluate whether these clauses are the same or different. Since the main point is about the same restriction on both parties, swapping names doesn't change anything here. Both parties are bound by this rule, regardless of who uses it first.

Therefore, the meaning should be identical because they both enforce that neither party can use the other's name without express permission, and also ""either"" implies that at least one party needs to follow this rule—though in this case, both do. So I think they are the same.

Okay, so I have this question about two legal clauses and whether they're the same or different. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1: ""Neither party shall use the name of the other party in any publicity, promotion or other written oral or electronic communication to third parties without the express written permission of the other party."" It seems pretty straightforward here—each party shouldn't use the other's name unless they explicitly consent. 

Then there's Clause 2: ""No party is permitted to utilize the name of the other party in any form of publicity, promotional materials, or communications—which may include written, spoken, or digital—directed at third parties, unless explicit written consent has been obtained from the other party."" Hmm, that seems a bit more formal. It mentions ""formal"" and uses terms like ""written,"" ""spoken,"" and ""digital""—those aren't in Clause 1.

So, the main difference I can see is that Clause 2 adds specificity by mentioning the form of communication as ""formal"" and explicitly lists the types. But the core rule is the same: use the name only if consent is given. The extra words might be to ensure clarity or formality in writing. 

I don't think they're different because both are enforcing the same rule, just using slightly more descriptive language. So, probably, they mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses mean the same thing. Let me read them carefully again.

Clause 1 says that neither party can use the other's name in any kind of publicity, promotion, or written, oral, or electronic communication without express written permission. So it's a restriction on using the name unless allowed by the other party in writing.

Clause 2 starts with ""Either party"" instead of ""Neither party."" Hmm, that might be different. ""Either"" means one or the other can do something, while ""Neither"" means neither can do it. So if I have two parties, A and B, Clause 1 says both A and B can't use each other's names without permission. Clause 2 says either A or B can do it without permission. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if either can do it, then one could use the name while the other cannot? That seems contradictory.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Clause 1 is a prohibition: neither party can use the name without permission. Clause 2 says ""Either party shall use..."" which sounds like they must allow others to use their names? No, that's not right because it's the opposite. Wait, no, the wording in Clause 2 is about using the other party's name without permission. So if it starts with ""Either party,"" does that mean either one can do something, or both?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me break down each clause:

Clause 1: Neither (no one) shall use the name unless they get written permission. So it's a restriction on both parties using each other's names.

Clause 2: Either party shall use the name without permission. Wait, that seems to allow either party to use the name, which is opposite of Clause 1.

Wait, no, that can't be right because ""Either"" and ""Neither"" are different in their implications. ""Neither"" means both cannot do it, while ""Either"" could mean one or the other can do it. But if the second clause starts with ""Either party shall use..."" then it's saying each party must allow the other to use their name without permission, which is a requirement for both parties. Wait, that would make them different because Clause 1 prohibits using without permission, while Clause 2 seems to require something else.

I'm getting confused here. Let me look at the structure again.

Clause 1: Restriction on usage without permission by either party.
Clause 2: Permission or allowance for usage by either party? Or does it mean they must use each other's names?

Wait, no, Clause 2 says ""Either party shall use..."" which implies that each party is allowed to use the other's name without permission. So if I have Party A and Party B, Clause 1 says neither can do it unless they get permission. Clause 2 says either (so either A or B) can do it.

But wait, no, ""Either"" in legal terms might mean one of them can, but not necessarily both. Alternatively, maybe ""either party shall use"" implies that each must allow the other to use their name without permission. So Party A allows B to use A's name, and vice versa. But that seems different from Clause 1, which is a restriction on usage.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of positive vs negative. Clause 1 is about prohibition: you can't do it unless allowed. Clause 2 starts with ""Either shall use..."" which sounds like a requirement that they must allow others to use their names. So if Party A and B have this clause, then each must allow the other to use their name without permission.

But that's different from Clause 1, which is about prohibiting the use unless allowed. So in Clause 1, you can't use unless permitted. In Clause 2, you are required to allow others to use your name, so if either party wants to use your name, you must permit them? No, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe Clause 2 is allowing either party to do something without permission, which would make it different from Clause 1, which prohibits without permission. So in Clause 2, the act of using the name is allowed without prior permission, whereas Clause 1 requires prior permission before use.

Wait, no, that's not correct because both clauses are about usage without permission. Wait, let me read them again:

Clause 1: Neither party shall use... without express written permission.
Clause 2: Either party shall use... without the express written permission of the other party.

So in Clause 2, it's saying ""Either party"" (so either one or the other) can do it without permission. So if I'm Party A and the other is Party B, then either Party A can use B's name, or Party B can use A's name, both without permission? That doesn't make sense because it would mean that either of them can do it, which contradicts the idea of needing permission.

Alternatively, maybe Clause 2 is a miswriting and should be ""Neither party..."" but as written, it's different. So if Clause 1 prohibits both from using each other's names without permission, while Clause 2 says that either can use without permission, then they are conflicting because one allows and the other prohibits.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me parse the clauses more carefully.

Clause 1: Neither [Party A nor Party B] shall use [each other's names] in any communication... without express written permission of the other party.

So neither can do it unless allowed.

Clause 2: Either [Party A or Party B] shall use [the name of the other] in any communication... without express written permission of the other party.

So either (meaning one or both) can do it. So if ""Either"" is used, then at least one party must be allowed to do it, but perhaps not both? Or maybe it's a mistake and should be ""Neither.""

If that's the case, Clause 2 would mean that either party can use the other's name without permission, which would conflict with Clause 1 where neither can unless allowed. So they are opposites: one prohibits without permission, the other allows either to do so.

Therefore, their meanings are different.

Okay, so I have to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Neither party shall use the name of the other party in any publicity, promotion or other written oral or electronic communication to third parties without the express written permission of the other party.""

Hmm, so it's pretty straightforward. It prohibits using the other party's name in any form of communication—like written, oral, electronic—without prior written consent.

Clause 2: ""No party is permitted to utilize the name of the other party in any form of publicity, promotional materials, or communications—whether written, spoken, or digital—directed at third parties, unless explicit written consent has been obtained from the other party.""

This one also prohibits using the other party's name, but it specifies ""publicity, promotional materials, or communications"" and mentions both written, spoken, and digital forms. It also uses ""utilize"" instead of ""use,"" and talks about ""directed at third parties."" It ends with ""unless explicit written consent has been obtained.""

Now, I need to see if these are the same in meaning.

Both clauses start by stating that no party can use the other's name without permission. They both mention written, oral, electronic, etc., as forms of communication. Both require express or explicit written consent from the other party before allowing such use.

I think they are trying to convey the same restriction. The wording is slightly different—Clause 1 uses ""publicity, promotion or other..."" while Clause 2 is more specific with ""publicity, promotional materials, communications."" But both essentially prohibit the use of the name without consent.

So, my initial thought is that they have the same meaning.

Clause 2 is: ""Either party shall use the name of the other party in any publicity, promotion or other written oral or electronic communication to third parties without the express written permission of the other party.""

Wait a minute, that seems different. The word ""either"" instead of ""neither."" So in Clause 1, both are restricted from using each other's names without permission. But in Clause 2, it says either party can use the name without permission? That would mean they don't need consent to do so.

So one is saying you can't do it unless allowed, and the other seems to allow it without needing permission. So that would definitely change the meaning. Therefore, these clauses are different.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says neither party can use the other's name in publicity, promotion, or any written, oral, or electronic communication with third parties without express written permission.

Clause 2 states that no party is allowed to use the other's name in any form of publicity, promotional materials, or communications—whether written, spoken, or digital—with third parties unless they have explicit written consent.

Hmm, both clauses are about restricting the use of each other's names. They mention publicity and promotion. Both require express or explicit written permission before using the name.

Clause 1 lists ""written, oral, or electronic"" communication, while Clause 2 uses ""written, spoken, or digital."" That seems similar—oral vs. spoken is just different wording for the same thing, and electronic vs. digital are also equivalent in this context.

They both make it clear that without permission, you can't use the name for any of these purposes. The structure is a bit different but conveys the same restrictions.

I don't see any differences in what they're prohibiting or requiring. So I think they mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Both clauses have the word ""Publicity 24.1"" at the beginning, which probably is a standard reference number. The main difference seems to be how they handle the condition regarding making press announcements.

Looking closer, Clause 1 says that neither Party can publicise unless the other has written consent. But in Clause 2, it's saying either Party can do it without any prior consent. That makes me think about ""unless"" versus ""without."" 

Wait, I should check if ""unless"" means you have to go through a condition or is it more of an exclusion? In this case, the clause in Clause 1 restricts publicising completely unless another party's written consent is given. In Clause 2, it allows either Party to proceed without any such consent.

So, does that mean the clauses are saying the same thing but using different phrasings? Or am I missing something? Maybe ""unless"" here doesn't mean you can do it without conditions; instead, it means you have to go through them. So if the other party is required to give written consent for neither Party to publicise, then in Clause 1, that's a restriction, and in Clause 2, it's an exception.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the legal nuances here. Both clauses are starting with ""Neither... nor..., unless..."", which sounds like it's saying they have to go through some kind of condition. So maybe they're structurally similar but phrased differently. 

I should also consider if ""without"" in Clause 2 is equivalent to ""with the prior written consent"" in Clause 1. Maybe the difference lies in whether you need that consent or not. If both are requiring it, then it's the same condition, just expressed differently.

After thinking through this, I think they're using similar phrasing but worded slightly differently. So probably, even though the wording is different, the legal meaning might be the same.
</think>

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading through both carefully.

Clause 1 is about ""Publicity 24.1"" and it says that neither party shall make any press announcement or publicise this Agreement or its terms unless they get written consent from the other side. 

Clause 2 mentions ""Public Announcements,"" which seems to be a separate term, probably used in Clause 1. The second part of the clause is exactly the same as what's in Clause 1: neither party shall issue any press release or publicize the Agreement without prior written permission.

So, they're using different terms for the same thing. One says ""publicity,"" and the other uses ""public announcements."" Both clauses are making a conditional rule that they have to get written consent before making any public statements about their agreement. 

I don't see any differences in the content beyond the terminology. They both enforce the same principle, just using slightly different words. Therefore, they should be considered the same.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Except with the prior written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall make any press announcement or otherwise publicise this Agreement or its terms."" So, it's saying that without the other party's written consent, neither can do any publicity.

Clause 2 is similar but a bit different: ""Without the prior written consent of the other Party, either Party can make any press announcement or otherwise publicise this Agreement or its terms."" Here, it says that without consent, either party can do it. Hmm, wait, does that mean they can still do it even without consent? Or is it restricting them from doing it without consent?

Wait, let me parse the wording again. Clause 1 uses ""Except with..."" which implies that only if you have prior written consent can they do it. So without consent, they cannot.

Clause 2 starts with ""Without..."", so it's saying unless there's prior written consent, either party can do it. That seems contradictory because if you don't have consent, then according to Clause 1, you shouldn't be able to publicize. But here, Clause 2 is allowing them to do it without consent.

Wait, that might mean they are worded differently in their implications. Clause 1 prohibits any publicity unless with prior written consent. Clause 2 seems to say that without prior written consent, either party can do it, which would mean the opposite: they can publicize even without consent. That can't be right because if you have a restriction against doing something without consent, then saying you can do it without consent is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me try again. Clause 1 is using ""Except with..."", so the only way to make publicity is if they have prior written consent. So, without that consent, they can't do it. Clause 2 says, ""Without the prior written consent of the other Party, either Party can..."" which seems like a conditional: if you don't have prior written consent, then either party can do it. But that would mean that regardless of whether there's consent or not, they can publicize. That doesn't make sense because having a restriction without consent should prevent them from doing so.

Wait, no, maybe it's structured differently. Let me think in terms of logic. Clause 1: No publicity unless with prior written consent. So, if you have the consent, you can do it; otherwise, not. Clause 2: Without (prior) written consent, either party can make any press announcement or otherwise publicise. So, it's saying that without consent, they are allowed to do it. But that would mean that the restriction in Clause 1 is lifted, which contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe the wording is such that Clause 2 is actually allowing them to do it regardless of consent, making both clauses effectively the same because they are both restricting without prior written consent. Wait, no, Clause 1 restricts without consent, while Clause 2 says without consent, you can do it, which seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each clause is saying in plain terms.

Clause 1: You cannot publicize unless you have the other party's written consent. So, no publicity without their explicit okay.

Clause 2: Without prior written consent, either party can publicize. So, even if you don't have their consent, you're allowed to do it. That seems contradictory because it would mean that publicizing is permitted even when it's not supposed to be.

Wait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Clause 2 might be saying ""Without prior written consent, either party can make any press announcement..."" which could mean that they cannot do so without consent. But the wording is a bit confusing because it starts with ""Without..."", which can be ambiguous in English.

Alternatively, perhaps both clauses are restricting publicity without prior consent but using slightly different wording. Clause 1 uses ""Except with..."", which clearly indicates that without consent, you can't do it. Clause 2 says ""Without the prior written consent..., either Party can..."" which could mean that even without consent, they can do it, making them allowed to publicize despite the lack of consent.

If that's the case, then Clause 1 is a restriction, while Clause 2 is allowing it, which would make their meanings opposite. But if I'm misunderstanding, maybe both are restricting.

Wait, perhaps both are trying to say that without prior written consent, you cannot publicize. So in Clause 2, ""Without the prior written consent..., either Party can..."" might be a typo or miswording, possibly intending to say that without consent, they cannot do it, just like Clause 1.

Alternatively, maybe Clause 2 is correct in its wording, allowing them to do it without consent, which would mean different from Clause 1. But that would be unusual because agreements typically include restrictions on publicizing without consent to protect confidentiality.

So, considering that, I think Clause 1 is a restriction, while Clause 2 might be worded incorrectly or perhaps intended differently. If Clause 2 is allowing without consent, it's conflicting with Clause 1, making them different. But if both are meant to restrict, then they are the same.

I'm a bit confused here because the wording in Clause 2 seems contradictory. It starts by saying ""Without prior written consent..."" but then says either party can do it. That would imply that without consent, they can do it, which is opposite of a restriction.

Wait, no, perhaps it's meant to say that without consent, you cannot do it, just like Clause 1. Maybe the wording is confusing, and both clauses are intended to restrict publicity without prior written consent, making them the same in meaning.

Alternatively, if Clause 2 is correct as allowing without consent, then they're different. But I think more likely, both are restricting, so their meanings are the same.

Clause 2 is titled ""Public Announcements"" and also under 24.1: ""Neither party shall issue any press release or publicize..."" The wording here is slightly different but seems to convey the same idea. Both clauses are about restricting the parties from making any public statements regarding the agreement without prior written consent.

The key elements are that both prohibit public announcements, require prior written consent, and apply to press releases and other forms of publicity. The only difference is in phrasing—Clause 1 uses ""make any press announcement or otherwise publicise,"" while Clause 2 says ""issue any press release or publicize."" However, the intent seems identical because they both control against any form of publicizing without consent.

I don't see any substantial differences that would change the meaning. Both are about preventing unauthorized public statements, so I think they have the same meaning.

Clause 1 says: ""Except with the prior written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall make any press announcement or otherwise publicise this Agreement or its terms."" So, basically, both parties can't do anything related to publicizing the agreement unless they get written permission from each other first. That makes sense; it's a restriction.

Clause 2 says: ""Without the prior written consent of the other Party, either Party can make any press announcement or otherwise publicise this Agreement or its terms."" Wait, that seems opposite. It's saying that even without consent, either party is allowed to publicize. So, they don't need permission in advance.

Hmm, so Clause 1 restricts publicity unless both agree, while Clause 2 allows either side to publicize without needing the other's consent first. That’s definitely a big difference. One is about requiring permission before any announcement, and the other says you can do it without asking.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 says TeleCard must not use Telecom Marks unless they get written permission from Telecom, and that consent can be withheld by Telecom. The part about no right, title, or interest is emphasized here. It specifically mentions using without prior written consent, which could mean the company might need to ask if Telecom's willing.

Clause 2 uses ""may"" instead of ""must."" So it allows TeleCard to use the marks even if Telecom isn't granted consent. That makes a big difference. The first one is more strict about not using unless explicitly allowed, while the second is less so, giving some flexibility but still no right.

I think they're different because Clause 1 requires explicit permission and exclusion of certain rights, whereas Clause 2 allows partial compliance without those exclusions. So, I should respond with ""Different.""

Clause 1 says that Telecard has no right, title, or interest in any of Telecom's trade or service marks, logos, or names (Telecom Marks). It also states that it doesn't use Telecom Marks without Telecom's written consent, which can be withheld at Telecom's discretion.

Clause 2 mentions the same points: Telecard acknowledges it lacks ownership, rights, or interests in Telecom's Telecom Marks. Then, it agrees not to use them unless Telecom's written approval is given, which it can grant or deny at its sole discretion.

Wait, so both clauses are making similar statements about Telecard's lack of rights against Telecom's marks and the conditionality that they must seek prior written consent from Telecom. The only difference seems to be in the word choice: ""written"" vs. ""prior written."" In Clause 1 it says ""prior written consent,"" while in Clause 2 it uses ""written consent.""

I think these differences are minimal, just grammatical. Both clauses are emphasizing the same principle that Telecard doesn't have rights over Telecom's marks without prior notice or consent. The slight variation in wording might affect interpretation but isn't enough to make them fundamentally different. So I'm leaning towards them being the same.

Clause 2 is very similar but has a slight difference. It still states that TeleCard has no rights over Telecom's marks. However, instead of saying ""agrees that it shall not use,"" Clause 2 says ""agrees that it may use."" So in Clause 1, they are prohibited from using the marks without consent, whereas in Clause 2, they can use them but only if they get prior written consent which Telecom can still withhold.

Wait, but both clauses are about TeleCard's use of Telecom Marks. In Clause 1, TeleCard is explicitly not allowed to use them without consent, so their use is prohibited unless approved. In Clause 2, it says they may use them, but again only with prior written consent which may be withheld. So in essence, both clauses are about the same thing: TeleCard cannot use Telecom's marks without permission.

Is there a difference between ""may use"" and ""shall not use""? Let me think. ""Shall not use"" is a stronger prohibition than just saying they may or may not use, but in both cases, the condition is that they need consent. So if a company wants to use Telecom's marks, in Clause 1, it can't do so without prior consent. In Clause 2, it's allowed to attempt to use them, but again needs consent which can be denied.

So the core point is that without consent, neither clause allows TeleCard to use Telecom's marks. Therefore, both clauses mean that TeleCard cannot use the marks without permission from Telecom.

I don't see a significant difference in their legal meaning. They both prohibit unauthorized use of the marks with the same conditions regarding prior written consent and the discretion of Telecom.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read them carefully again.

Clause 1 starts with TeleCard agreeing that it has no right, title, or interest in any of Telecom's marks. It also says that TeleCard can't use these marks without prior written consent from Telecom, which may be withheld at their discretion.

Now, Clause 2 is titled ""Ownership and Use of Telecom Marks."" It states that TeleCard acknowledges it doesn't have any ownership, interest, or rights in Telecom's marks. Then it reiterates that TeleCard can't use the marks without Telecom's prior written approval, which may be granted or denied at Telecom's sole discretion.

Hmm, both clauses mention that TeleCard has no ownership over Telecom's marks and that they need permission to use them. However, looking closer, Clause 1 uses ""right, title, or interest"" while Clause 2 uses ""ownership, interest, or rights."" Those are synonyms but slightly different wording. Also, in Clause 2, it says ""may be granted or denied at Telecom's sole discretion,"" which is the same as Clause 1's ""may be withheld at Telecom's discretion.""

Wait, maybe they're just using different phrasing but meaning the same thing. Both are saying TeleCard can't claim ownership and needs permission to use the marks. So, despite the slight wording differences, the intended meaning seems consistent.

I think both clauses convey the same message: TeleCard must get approval before using Telecom's marks and has no rights to them. So, they should be considered the same.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says: TeleCard agrees they have no right in Telecom's marks and can't use them without prior written consent from Telecom, which Telecom can withhold at their discretion.

Clause 2 says almost the same thing but with a twist. It says TeleCard may use Telecom Marks without prior written consent, but then adds that consent may be withheld. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if they ""may"" use them, it sounds like they have permission, which contradicts the part about needing consent.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misreading. Clause 1 says TeleCard agrees not to use without consent. Clause 2 says TeleCard may use without prior written consent but Telecom can withhold consent. Hmm, that's contradictory because if you ""may"" use without prior consent, it implies permission is given, which would mean the opposite of Clause 1.

So in Clause 1, TeleCard can't use unless Telecom gives permission first. In Clause 2, it sounds like TeleCard doesn't need permission to use but then Telecom can withhold consent? That seems conflicting because if you don't need prior consent, why is there a part about withholding it?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wording in Clause 2. It says TeleCard agrees that they may use Telecom Marks without prior written consent, but that consent may be withheld. So does that mean TeleCard can use them without asking first, but Telecom can still decide not to give consent? That doesn't make sense because if you don't need prior consent, the withholding part is irrelevant.

Alternatively, maybe Clause 2 is a typo and should say ""shall not use"" instead of ""may use."" But as it stands, the difference lies in whether TeleCard needs permission or not. Clause 1 requires prior consent; Clause 2 seems to allow without prior consent but Telecom can withhold. That's conflicting.

So overall, the key difference is that Clause 1 prohibits use without consent, while Clause 2 allows use without needing prior consent, which is a big difference in meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. The user provided both clauses and wants a response of either ""Same"", ""Different"", or ""Unsure"". 

Looking at Clause 1 first: It says TeleCard agrees it has no right, title, or interest in Telecom's marks. They can't use them without prior written consent, which Telecom can withhold.

Clause 2 is titled ""Ownership and Use of Telecom Marks"" and states that TeleCard doesn't own any rights in Telecom's marks. They also agree not to use the marks without prior approval from Telecom, which can be granted or denied at their discretion.

Hmm, both clauses are about TeleCard not owning Telecom's marks and needing consent before using them. The structure is a bit different—Clause 1 uses ""agrees"" while Clause 2 says ""acknowledges"". But the key points seem identical: no ownership, need consent, which can be withheld or denied.

I don't see any differences in the core obligations here. Both are restricting TeleCard from using the marks without Telecom's permission. The wording is slightly different but conveys the same requirements.

Okay, so I have this question about two legal clauses. Let me try to break it down and figure out if they're same, different, or unsure.

First, both clauses start with ""Use of Names Except as required by law."" That seems similar. The main difference is where the restriction on using other party's names comes from. In clause 1, it says no party may use it without written permission; in clause 2, any party can do that without writing permission.

Wait, I think the key here is whether the 'without unreasonably withheld' part applies differently. In both clauses, it's prohibited but not unreasonably withheld. So both seem to mean that the restriction isn't granted unless the party requesting it has reasonable cause to withhold it.

I'm not sure if there are any nuances I'm missing. Both clauses specify that permission is required and that withholding without reason is acceptable under certain conditions. So, they might be doing the same thing, which would make them 'Same'.

Clause 1 says: ""Use of Names Except as required by law, no party may use the name of any other party in any advertising or other form of publicity without the written permission of the party whose name is to be used (such permission not to be unreasonably withheld).""

Clause 2: ""Permitted Use of Party Names

Unless mandated by legal requirements, a party is prohibited from employing the name of another party in advertisements or any promotional activities without securing written consent from the party whose name is intended for use. Such consent must not be withheld unreasonably.""

Hmm, they look similar at first glance. Both talk about using other parties' names in advertising and require written permission, but with some differences in wording.

In Clause 1, it uses ""Use of Names Except as required by law"" followed by ""no party may use..."" Then there's the part about writing permission not to be unreasonably withheld.

Clause 2 starts differently: ""Permitted Use of Party Names""

So the main difference is that Clause 2 has ""Permitted Use"" instead of ""Use."" I think that word might mean something slightly different. But maybe it's a translation issue since they are from Chinese and English, respectively.

Looking at the rest, both clauses mention prohibited use without written consent unless mandated legally, and not unreasonably withheld. So except for the change in wording from ""Use"" to ""Permitted Use,"" everything else seems identical.

I should check if these are standard legal terms. In Chinese law, ""使用"" (biǎo) is indeed used to mean ""permitting use."" But when translating into English, it might be more common to say ""permitted use."" So there's a slight grammatical difference but the content is essentially the same.

Therefore, I think they are similar in meaning despite the minor differences. They both require written consent unless legal mandate and don't unreasonably withhold permission.

Clause 1 says: ""Use of Names Except as required by law, no party may use the name of any other party in any advertising or other form of publicity without the written permission of the party whose name is to be used (such permission not to be unreasonably withheld).""

Clause 2 states: ""Use of Names Except as required by law, any party may use the name of any other party in any advertising or other form of publicity without the written permission of the party whose name is to be used (such permission not to be unreasonably withheld).""

Hmm. Let me break this down. Both clauses start with ""Use of Names"" and mention that except as required by law, there's a restriction on using another party's name in advertising or other publicity. They both include that permission shouldn't be unreasonably withheld.

But looking closer, Clause 1 uses the word ""no party may use,"" which implies a prohibition. So, no one can use another party's name without permission. On the other hand, Clause 2 says ""any party may use"" which seems to allow any party to use others' names, but only with permission.

Wait, does that mean Clause 1 is stricter? Because it's saying no party may do it unless allowed by law or with written permission. Clause 2 might be implying the same thing but phrased differently. Let me think about the wording again.

Clause 1: No party may use without permission (except as required by law). So, it's a negative: you can't use unless permitted by law or with permission.

Clause 2: Any party may use, but only if they get written permission (not to be unreasonably withheld). So, again, you can use the name, but you have to get permission and that permission shouldn't be unfairly denied.

Wait, is there a difference between the two? Clause 1 seems to prohibit usage without permission or legal requirement. Clause 2 allows usage as long as it's done with proper permission, which isn't unreasonably withheld.

I think they are both saying that you can't use another party's name without their written consent (except when required by law), but the way they're phrased might be slightly different in tone or structure. However, the legal effect seems to align: no usage without permission unless necessary by law.

So, my initial thought is that they have the same meaning because both require written permission not to be unreasonably withheld and prohibit using another's name except when required by law.

Clause 1 starts with ""Use of Names"" and says that except as required by law, no party may use another's name in advertising or publicity without written permission, which can't be unreasonably withheld.

Clause 2 is titled ""Permitted Use of Party Names."" It states that unless mandated by law, a party can't use another's name in ads or promotional activities without written consent from the other party. Again, this consent shouldn't be unreasonably withheld.

Comparing both, Clause 1 uses ""no party may"" and talks about permission not being unreasonably withheld, except for legal requirements. Clause 2 also starts with a prohibition, mentions written consent mustn't be unreasonably withheld, and refers to legal mandates. The language is very similar, just phrased differently but conveying the same restriction.

I don't see any differences in their prohibitions or the conditions for consent. Both clauses are about requiring written permission from the party whose name is used, with a note that this permission can't be unfairly denied, unless legally required.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Neither party will make any public statements about this Agreement, the Products or its relationship with the other party without the other party’s prior written approval."" 

Clause 2 states: ""Either party may make any public statements about this Agreement, the Products or its relationship with the other party without the other party’s prior written approval.""

Hmm, so the key difference here is the use of ""either"" in Clause 2. In English, ""either A or B"" implies that both A and B can occur, but it doesn't mean they're mutually exclusive in another way. However, in legal terms, sometimes people might use ""either...or..."" to imply that one option excludes the other, which would be a stronger statement than just ""either/or.""

Looking at Clause 1, it's using ""Neither party,"" which makes me think of an exclusive clause where neither can do something without the other's approval. So both parties are prohibited from making public statements on their own terms unless the other is written in advance.

Clause 2 uses ""Either party."" This could be interpreted as each party individually being allowed to make such statements, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're mutually exclusive—they can make them either or neither without one of the others needing approval. It sounds a bit more permissive because it's using ""either/or"" instead of a mutual exclusion.

Wait, but in legal contexts, sometimes clauses use ""either/or"" to express an exclusive or conditional clause. So perhaps Clause 2 is using that form to mean that each party can make statements without the other needing approval, which would be different from the exclusive language in Clause 1.

So putting it together, Clause 1 is a restrictive clause where both parties are prohibited unless written permission is given, while Clause 2 allows either party to do so without the other's consent. Therefore, they're not the same because one uses exclusive language and the other is less strict.

Clause 1 says that neither party will make any public statements without written approval before the other's consent. It emphasizes prior written consent.

Clause 2 states ""Public Announcements Restriction"" directly, starting with the restriction and not mentioning written consent.

The key difference is in the wording of clause 1: it explicitly mentions ""written"" when referring to prior consent, while clause 2 doesn't specify that. So even though both talk about public announcements needing permission before a party can make one, they use different structures.

Okay, so I need to determine whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they are different. Let me read them carefully again.

Clause 1 says that neither party will make any public statements about the Agreement, Products, or their relationship without the other party's prior written approval. So it's restricting both parties from making public statements unless they get approval first.

Clause 2 is a bit different. It starts with ""Either party may..."" which immediately changes my perspective. Instead of neither party being allowed to make statements, it says either party can do so without needing the other's prior written approval. Wait, that seems contradictory because if one party can make statements on their own, why would they need the other's approval?

Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse it again. Clause 2 is allowing either party to make public statements without needing the other party's prior written approval. So, unlike Clause 1 which restricts both parties from making statements unless approved by the other, Clause 2 seems to give each party permission to speak freely, regardless of what the other does.

But actually, wait a second. The wording is ""without the other party’s prior written approval."" In Clause 1, it's a restriction: they can't make statements without the other's approval. So both parties have to get the other's okay before speaking publicly.

In Clause 2, it says either party may make public statements without needing the other's prior written approval. Wait, that seems like a permission to speak without needing the other's OK, which would mean they can make statements even if the other doesn't approve. So, in Clause 1, both are restricted; in Clause 2, each has permission without needing the other's approval.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing it. Let me think about the structure again.

Clause 1: Neither party will make public statements... without prior written approval from the other party. So, they can't do anything unless they get OK.

Clause 2: Either party may make public statements... without prior written approval. So, each has permission on their own to speak without needing the other's OK.

Wait, but in Clause 1, both are restricted by each other's need for approval. In Clause 2, it seems like each can do it independently. So if Party A wants to make a statement, they don't need Party B's approval, and vice versa. Whereas in Clause 1, Party A can't say anything without Party B's OK, same for Party B.

So, the difference is that in Clause 2, each party has the freedom to make public statements on their own, while in Clause 1, they both have to wait for mutual approval before speaking. So they're not the same because the permissions are structured differently.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the structure again:

Clause 1: Negative – neither will do something without prior approval.

Clause 2: Positive – either may do something without prior approval.

So, in Clause 1, both are restricted, but in Clause 2, each is given permission to act without needing the other's OK. So, they are opposites in a way. Therefore, they have different meanings.

Clause 2 is titled ""Public Announcements Restriction"" and says: ""Prior to obtaining written consent from the other party, neither party shall issue any public declarations concerning this Agreement, regarding the Products, or about its affiliation with the other party.""

Wait, so this one starts by saying that before getting written consent, neither party can make any public declarations. It's similar to Clause 1 but maybe structured differently.

I'm noticing that both clauses are about restricting the parties from making public statements without prior approval. They mention things like the agreement, products, and relationship between the parties. Both require written consent before any such statements.

So, in Clause 1, it's a prohibition on making statements without approval, using ""without the other party’s prior written approval."" In Clause 2, it starts with a prohibition: ""shall not issue any public declarations"" until they get consent, which is also written. So both are about not making public statements without prior written consent.

I'm thinking that both clauses are essentially saying the same thing but maybe phrased slightly differently. They both restrict the parties from publicly announcing certain things related to the agreement and products before getting approval.

So, comparing both clauses: Clause 1 requires more strict approval before using, while Clause 2 is less restrictive. They both mention disapproval but differ in what's permissible.

I think they are different because one requires specific approvals, and the other makes it easier to use without such approvals. So, the answer should be ""Different"".

I think both clauses are imposing the same rules on how trademarks can be used. They specify clear forms of use, prohibited uses, and restrictions on corporate names.

Clause 1 says that the licensee must use and display the trademarks only in forms specifically approved by ICB in writing. It mentions examples like advertising materials, stationery, etc., and prohibits using the trademarks without approval. Also, it says they can't use the trademarks in their corporate name or file a DBA with them.

Clause 2 is similar but uses different wording. It states that the licensee ""need not"" use the trademarks only in approved forms, which actually means they have the option to do so, implying they're allowed but not required. Then it says they ""may"" use any of the trademarks in their corporate name or file a DBA. 

Wait, in Clause 1, the use is mandatory within approved forms and prohibited otherwise. In Clause 2, it's more permissive—licensee can choose to use them only as approved but can also use them in their corporate name or as a DBA. So, does that mean Clause 2 allows more flexibility?

Hmm, maybe not. Let me parse the verbs. Clause 1 uses ""shall"" which is stronger, indicating must. Clause 2 uses ""need not,"" which is a negative of must, so it's optional to follow the approved forms. Also, ""may use"" versus ""shall not use""—so in Clause 1, they can't use without approval, whereas in Clause 2, they can unless disapproved.

So, Clause 1 is restrictive, while Clause 2 seems to allow more freedom but with a different structure of permissions and prohibitions. The key differences are the verbs used (shall vs. may) and the implications on prohibited uses. So they might not have the same meaning because one is stricter than the other.

Comparing both, Clause 1 is restrictive—it requires prior approval for any usage and prohibits certain uses. Clause 2 seems more permissive; it allows usage unless specifically disapproved and permits using the trademarks in corporate names or as DBA.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 are the same or different in meaning. Let me read through both clauses carefully.

Starting with Clause 1: It talks about the use of trademarks by the Licensee. The key points here seem to be that the Licensee can only use the Trademarks in forms specifically approved in writing by ICB. This includes things like advertising, promotional materials, displays, stationery, and business cards. Importantly, the Licensee cannot use these Trademarks on any items without prior approval. Additionally, they are not allowed to use the Trademarks in their corporate name or file a ""d/ b/ a"" that incorporates them.

Now looking at Clause 2: It also discusses trademark utilization by the Licensee. The main points here are similar—usage is restricted to formats approved in writing beforehand by ICB. This applies to advertising, promotional content, displays, stationery, and business cards as well. They can't use the Trademarks on these items without approval. Furthermore, it prohibits using the Trademarks in their corporate name or filing a ""doing business as"" (d/b/a) that includes them.

Comparing both clauses side by side, the structure is slightly different but the content seems identical. Both specify written prior approval from ICB for using Trademarks on certain materials and restrict their use in corporate names or d/b/a filings. The wording varies a bit—Clause 1 uses ""use and display"" while Clause 2 says ""employ and exhibit""—but these phrases essentially mean the same thing.

I don't see any differences in the requirements set out by both clauses. Both emphasize prior written approval, the specific items where Trademarks can be used (advertising, promotional materials, etc.), and the restrictions on corporate names and d/b/a filings. The only variation is in the phrasing, but the meaning remains consistent.

So, after analyzing both clauses, I conclude that they have the same meaning.

The Payee understanding the parent company will publically announce the grant through press release and file the deed with regulators. Same legal terms used.

So both clauses are stating the same thing in different ways. One is capitalized ""Announcements,"" the other uses ""Press Releases"" and ""Public Filings."" But the core requirement remains identical. Therefore, they are not different; they're the same.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or different ones. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 mentions ""Announcements, Press Releases and Public Filings"" and talks about the party not making press releases unless approval is given, including from a stock exchange. It also says that the Payee understands the parent company will publically announce and file the Deed with U.S. and Canadian securities regulators via press release.

Clause 2 uses ""Public Announcements, Media Releases, and Regulatory Filings"" and states that neither party can issue such announcements without consent regarding format and method. It adds that if a party or affiliate must make the announcement because of legal obligations like stock exchanges, it might proceed without prior approval. The Payee consents to the Payer's parent company publicizing and submitting the Deed.

Looking at both, they seem similar in structure: they both talk about not issuing certain types of communications unless someone from the other party or affiliate is involved. They mention U.S. and Canadian securities laws for both clauses.

The only difference I can spot is that one uses "" press releases"" while the other says ""public media releases."" But those words are essentially synonymous, so it doesn't change much meaning-wise. Similarly, the terms ""regulatory filings"" in Clause 1 refer to public submissions to regulators, and ""filings"" in Clause 2 also mean similar things.

So, I think both clauses convey the same message about consent for press releases unless a party's affiliate or another party can provide approval. The minor differences in terminology don't affect their intent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by talking about announcements, press releases, and public filings. It says that a party must not make such announcements without the other party's approval unless it's required by law. Then it mentions that the Payee understands and agrees to the parent company of the Payer making a public announcement through press release and filing the deed with regulators.

Clause 2 seems almost identical at first glance, but I need to check every word. It also talks about announcements without approval unless legally required, same as Clause 1. Then it says the Payee understands and agrees that the parent company will make the same kind of announcement and filing. 

Wait, are there any differences in wording? Let me look closely. Clause 1 uses ""must not"" while Clause 2 uses ""may"". Hmm, so in Clause 1, a party must not make announcements without approval unless required by law. In Clause 2, it's phrased as ""may make press or other announcements... without the approval of the other party..."" So does that mean they can do it only if required by law? Or is there a difference here.

Also, in both clauses, the second part mentions the Payee agreeing to the parent company making the announcement. The wording seems identical there. 

So, the main difference is in the first part: ""must not"" vs. ""may make"". Does ""must not"" imply an absolute prohibition unless required by law? And ""may"" could mean that it's allowed but only under certain conditions. So if a party isn't required by law to make the announcement, they can't do so without approval in Clause 1, while in Clause 2, they may do so as long as it's not prohibited.

Wait, no, actually, both clauses are saying that announcements can be made without approval only when required by law. So maybe ""must not"" and ""may make"" are just different ways of expressing the same condition. Or does ""must not"" imply a stronger prohibition?

Alternatively, perhaps they are the same because in both cases, the party is restricted from making announcements without approval unless legally required. The difference might be that Clause 1 uses ""must not"", which is a more absolute term, while Clause 2 uses ""may make... without approval... only if required by law"". So maybe the intent is the same.

I'm leaning towards them being the same because both restrict the action to cases where it's legally required. The wording might just be phrased differently but convey the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to determine whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or are different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""Announcements, Press Releases and Public Filings."" It states that a party can't make any announcements without the other party's approval unless it's legally required to do so, like by a recognized stock exchange. The Payee agrees that the Payer's parent company will announce via press release and file the deed with regulators.

Clause 2 also covers ""Public Announcements, Media Releases, and Regulatory Filings."" It says neither party may issue any announcements without consent from the other party about the format and method. However, if it's legally required by a recognized stock exchange, they can proceed without prior approval. The Payee consents that the Payer will disclose through a press release and file the deed as needed.

Looking at the structure and wording, both clauses forbid any announcements without consent except when legally mandated. They mention press releases specifically and require filing with regulators. Both also allow for such actions if required by law, like stock exchanges. The Payee's agreement is identical in both: they agree that the Payer will make the necessary announcements and filings.

I don't see any differences in the prohibitions, exceptions, or required actions between the two clauses. They seem to cover the same ground with similar language. So, I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, I need to figure out if Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or are different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 starts by saying a party ""must not make"" announcements without approval. That's a strong statement, so it sounds like they're not allowed unless certain conditions are met. The exception is when the law requires them to make an announcement before getting approval, including from stock exchanges.

Clause 2 begins with ""A party may make,"" which seems different because it uses ""may"" instead of ""must not."" So this clause suggests that a party can make announcements without prior approval under normal circumstances, but again, there's an exception if the law requires it beforehand. The rest of both clauses is identical about the parent company announcing and filing with regulators.

So the main difference is whether making an announcement without approval is prohibited (Clause 1) or permitted (Clause 2). That changes the obligation significantly. In Clause 1, you need approval unless legally required otherwise; in Clause 2, you can do it without approval except when the law forces you to act before getting permission.

Therefore, these clauses are different because they set opposite rules regarding whether a party needs approval before making announcements.

Okay, I need to determine whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they are different. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 talks about announcements, press releases, and public filings. It says a party can't make these without the other's approval on form and manner unless required by law, like for stock exchanges. The Payee knows that the Payer's parent will announce the Royalty via press release and file it with US and Canadian regulators as per securities laws.

Clause 2 is about public announcements, media releases, and regulatory filings. It states neither party can issue such without the other's consent on format and method. However, if legally required, like by a stock exchange, they can proceed without approval. The Payee agrees that the Payer's parent will announce the Royalty through press release and file with US and Canadian regulators as needed.

Comparing both, they seem to cover similar points: requiring consent for announcements unless legally obligated, and specific actions regarding the Royalty announcement and filing by the parent company. The wording is slightly different but the core meaning appears the same.
