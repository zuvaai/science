Alright, let's see what I'm supposed to do here. The user has given me two legal clauses and wants to know if they have the same meaning or not. They also mentioned responding with ""Same,"" ""Different,"" or ""Unsure."" 

First, I'll need to read both clauses carefully to understand their content. 

Clause 1 says that UPS must send copies of records back no more than once a year to GUPTA for review after receiving a reasonable advance request. That's an ""only"" clause.

Clause 2 states that they can only send copies after more than one annual request, but it doesn't specify the limit beyond that. It just says ""more than once annually,"" which is different from saying ""no more than once.""

The key difference here is the use of ""only"" in Clause 1 versus ""only more than once"" in Clause 2. The word ""only"" implies a strict limit, while ""more than once"" allows for multiple times. So these clauses have opposite meanings.

I should also consider the context and whether ""once annually"" might change this, but I don't think so because both clauses specify annual limits. Therefore, they are clearly different in meaning.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review."" The key here is ""reasonable advance"" and ""on average one per year.""

Clause 2 states: ""Upon receiving a reasonable prior request from GUPTA, not exceeding one per year, UPS is obligated to dispatch copies of these records to GUPTA for examination."" It uses ""prior request"" without specifying if it's reasonable. It just says ""reasonable,"" which might mean either acceptable or not excessive.

Now, I think about the difference between ""reasonable advance"" and ""prior request."" The first one talks about a request being made in advance—like before receiving the document—and then the action after that. The second clause is about a prior request received by UPS. 

So, Clause 1 seems to be more specific because it's about making an advance request first and then dispatching copies for review. It's setting a limit on how often this should happen. On the other hand, Clause 2 doesn't specify if it's a reasonable prior request or just any prior request. That could mean that a request received by UPS is subject to being dispatched even if it's an unreasonably high number.

But wait, I'm not sure if ""reasonable"" in both clauses applies equally. Maybe the wording makes a difference. In Clause 1, ""on reasonable advance,"" so only requests before GUPTA actually come can be reasonable. In Clause 2, it just says ""upon receiving a reasonable prior request."" So perhaps there's a slight variation here.

I'm also considering if both clauses are imposing that GUPTA doesn't send copies more than once per year and that UPS has to dispatch them after receiving a request. But the wording is different in their approach—Clause 1 seems stricter because it mentions ""reasonable advance,"" while Clause 2 is more general about any prior request.

So, I think they're somewhat similar but not exactly the same. The first one sets up the condition upfront and specifies a limit, whereas the second allows for a bit more flexibility without explicitly stating the reasonability.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review.""

Clause 2 is: ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA only more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review.""

Hmm, both clauses start the same way, with ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA..."" So the beginning is identical. Now, I need to check the differences in their wording.

In Clause 1, after ""upon reasonable advance request,"" it says ""not more than once annually."" That means UPS can send the records once a year at most. 

Clause 2 uses ""only more than once annually."" The word ""only"" here is interesting. It's saying that UPS must send the records only when it does so more than once annually. Wait, but ""more than once annually"" is already stated in Clause 1 as ""not more than once annually,"" which actually means once a year or less. So there might be confusion here.

Wait, let me parse this again. Clause 1: not more than once annually. That's zero or one time per year. Clause 2: only more than once annually, so UPS must send the records multiple times a year. But that seems contradictory because if they have to send ""only"" when it's more than once, but in Clause 1, they can do it once or not at all.

So perhaps there's a difference in how the frequency is restricted. In Clause 1, it's limited to once a year, while Clause 2 requires it to be done multiple times a year. But wait, ""only more than once"" might mean that UPS can only send them when it does so more than once, but if they do it once, it doesn't satisfy the condition for sending.

Wait, no, actually, in Clause 2, it's saying that UPS must send copies upon a reasonable advance request from GUPTA, but only if it's done more than once annually. So if GUPTA requests, and if UPS sends more than once annually, then they do it. But if they send once or not at all, perhaps the condition isn't met.

But in Clause 1, it's saying that upon a reasonable advance request from GUPTA, UPS will send copies not more than once annually. So they can send once a year, but no more.

So essentially, Clause 1 allows one request per year, while Clause 2 is phrased differently—using ""only more than once,"" which might imply that the service is only provided when it's done multiple times, but perhaps it's not entirely clear.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure:

Clause 1: Upon request, UPS sends records not more than once annually.

Clause 2: Upon request, UPS sends records only if it's more than once annually.

But in Clause 1, it's a limitation on the frequency—so they can do it once or less. In Clause 2, it's saying that they must send only when it's done more than once, which would mean that sending once wouldn't satisfy the condition, so they don't have to send in that case.

But is that the correct interpretation? Or does ""only more than once"" mean that the only time they can send is when it's more than once? So if they need to send once, but the clause says they must do it only when it's more than once, then perhaps Clause 2 is stricter—they have to do multiple sends.

Wait, no. Let me think again: ""only more than once annually."" That could mean that the action (sending copies) can only be done if it happens more than once a year. So if they're being asked and they send it once, that's not enough because it's not more than once. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe ""upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA only more than once annually"" could mean that the request must be made more than once annually, but that seems less likely because the wording is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that in Clause 1, UPS can choose to send once or not at all, while in Clause 2, they have to send multiple times. So if they are asked once, under Clause 2, they don't have to send because it's not more than once. That seems different.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to look at it: both clauses allow the request to be made only once a year, but in different ways. Maybe they mean the same thing because ""not more than once"" and ""only more than once"" can imply the same maximum frequency of once annually.

Wait, no. ""Not more than once"" allows zero or one. ""Only more than once"" implies that it has to be done two or more times. So if Clause 2 requires multiple sends, then they are different because Clause 1 allows at most once.

So, I think the meaning is different. Because in Clause 1, UPS can choose not to send (zero) or send once a year, while Clause 2 would require that when they do send, it's done more than once annually. So if someone asks once, under Clause 2, UPS doesn't have to comply because it's not more than once.

Therefore, the clauses are different.

Okay, I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with Clause 1: It says that UPS ""shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review."" So, the key points here are the ""reasonable advance request"" made by GUPTA and that this can happen no more than once a year. UPS is obliged to provide the copies for review.

Now looking at Clause 2: It states that upon receiving a ""reasonable prior request from GUPTA,"" not exceeding one per year, UPS is obligated to dispatch copies of these records to GUPTA for examination. Here, the trigger is a ""reasonable prior request"" instead of an advance request, and it's also limited to one per year.

The main difference I notice is in how the requests are phrased. Clause 1 uses ""advance request,"" which implies that the request is made before something happens, like planning or preparing. Clause 2 uses ""prior request,"" which might mean a request that comes before an event, but it's slightly less specific.

However, both clauses specify that the request should be reasonable and can only happen once a year. They also mention that UPS has to send the records, so the obligations are similar in that regard.

I'm wondering if ""advance"" and ""prior"" make a significant difference here. In legal terms, they might not change much because both imply a request made before a certain point in time. So, even though the wording is different, the meaning could be the same because they're both referring to requests made beforehand within the same timeframe.

Therefore, I think these clauses are likely the same in meaning because they both describe similar conditions for requests and obligations by UPS.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me look at them closely.

Clause 1 says: ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review.""

Clause 2 states: ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA only more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review.""

Hmm, the key difference seems to be in the phrases ""not more than once annually"" versus ""only more than once annually."" Let me break this down.

In Clause 1, ""not more than once annually"" means that UPS is required to send the records no more than one time per year. So GUPTA can request up to once a year, and UPS must comply each time, but not exceed that frequency without a request.

On the other hand, Clause 2 says ""only more than once annually."" This seems to imply that UPS is only allowed to send the records if it's more than once a year. That doesn't quite make sense because ""only"" here might be emphasizing that they must send more than once annually whenever GUPTA requests.

Wait, maybe I'm interpreting this wrong. Let me rephrase both:

Clause 1: UPS will send upon request, but not more than once a year without a request? Or is it that upon each reasonable advance request, which can happen up to once a year?

Actually, the wording in Clause 1 is ""upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually."" So perhaps it's saying that GUPTA can make such a request no more than once per year. So UPS must respond when requested, butGUPTA can't ask more than once a year.

Clause 2: ""only more than once annually"" might mean that UPS is required to send the records only if GUPTA requests them more than once a year. That seems contradictory because if it's ""only more than once,"" then perhaps it's saying that they must be sent multiple times upon request, but that doesn't align well.

Wait, another interpretation: Maybe Clause 2 is trying to say that UPS can send the records only when GUPTA requests them more than once a year. But that seems odd because why would GUPTA need more frequent sending unless requested?

Alternatively, perhaps ""only more than once annually"" is meant to mean that if there's a request, it must be done more than once. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the modifiers:

Clause 1: Upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually.

So, the request can happen no more than once per year. So UPS has to send when requested, but GUPTA can only ask once a year.

Clause 2: Upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA only more than once annually.

This might mean that the requests are only made more than once annually? Or that the sending must be done only if it's more than once.

Alternatively, perhaps ""only more than once annually"" is intended to mean that the number of times UPS sends is limited to being no more than once a year. But that would make it similar to Clause 1.

Wait, but ""only more than once"" could imply that it must be sent at least twice? That's conflicting because if it's only allowed when it's more than once annually, then perhaps it's about the number of requests?

I'm getting confused here. Let me compare them again:

Clause 1 restricts the frequency of the request to no more than once a year.

Clause 2 says ""only more than once annually,"" which is confusing because if you only do something when it's more than once, that could imply that it must be done multiple times upon each request. Or perhaps it's saying that UPS can send only if GUPTA requests more than once. That doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe Clause 2 is a typo and meant to say ""not less than once annually,"" but as it stands, the wording is different enough to change the meaning.

In summary, Clause 1 limits the number of requests GUPTA can make per year (up to once), while Clause 2 seems to imply that the sending occurs only when there are multiple requests, which changes the obligation on UPS. Therefore, they have different meanings.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""UPS shall upon reasonable advance request from GUPTA not more than once annually send copies of these records to GUPTA for review."" 

Clause 2 states: ""Upon receiving a reasonable prior request from GUPTA, not exceeding one per year, UPS is obligated to dispatch copies of these records to GUPTA for examination.""

First, I'll break down each clause. Both involve UPS sending records to Gupta upon request. Let's look at the key elements:

1. **Triggering Event**: In Clause 1, it's a ""reasonable advance request"" from Gupta. In Clause 2, it's a ""reasonable prior request."" The terms ""advance"" and ""prior"" seem similar here, both indicating that the request comes before UPS sends the records.

2. **Frequency Constraint**: Both limit the number of requests to once a year. Clause 1 says ""not more than once annually,"" while Clause 2 uses ""not exceeding one per year."" That's pretty much the same thing.

3. **Action Required by UPS**: Clause 1 specifies that UPS ""shall send copies... for review."" Clause 2 states that UPS is ""obligated to dispatch copies... for examination."" Both use slightly different verbs—""send"" vs. ""dispatch""—but they essentially mean the same action of delivering the records.

4. **Purpose of Sending**: In Clause 1, it's ""for review,"" while in Clause 2, it's ""for examination."" Review and examine are synonyms in this context; both imply a thorough look at the records by Gupta.

Putting it all together, every component of the clauses aligns: who is requesting (Gupta), the reasonableness of the request, the annual limit on requests, the obligation of UPS to send records, and the purpose for which the records are sent. The slight differences in wording don't change the meaning; they just use synonyms or slightly rephrase the same concepts.

I'm pretty confident that both clauses are expressing the exact same requirement but using different phrasing. Therefore, they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. The user gave me two clauses, Clause 1 and Clause 2, both referring to an audit procedure involving FCE and POSCO Power. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""At its expense, FCE may, by its designated independent public accountants, audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year."" Then it goes on about copying records for such an audit. It also mentions that to the extent any sales are made by any POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power agrees to give FCE copies of relevant books and records.

Clause 2 says: ""At its expense, FCE may not, by its designated independent public accountants, audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than a year."" It also mentions that to the extent any sales are made by POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power does not agree to give copies of records.

Hmm. The main difference seems in the structure of their clauses. Let me break them down.

Clause 1 starts with ""At its expense, FCE may,"" followed by a conditional audited amount and then another conditional clause about the company's agreements. Clause 2 is similar but uses ""may not"" instead of ""may."" So, one says ""may audit up to once a year,"" while the other says ""may not audit up to once a year.""

Additionally, both clauses mention that when sales are made by POSCO Affiliates, they agree or don't agree to give copies. The verbs in each clause are different: Clause 1 uses ""may"" and ""agree to furnish copies for the sole purpose of such audit,"" while Clause 2 uses ""may not"" and ""does not agree to furnish copies.""

Wait, let me check the exact wording again. In Clause 1, it's a present tense conditional with an infinitive on the first part: ""At its expense, FCE may, by its designated independent public accountants, audit...no more than once a year."" Then, for the next part: ""To the extent any sales are made by POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power agrees to furnish...for the sole purpose of such audit by FCE.""

In Clause 2, it's similar except that instead of ""may,"" it says ""may not"" and uses ""does not."" So both clauses have similar structures but with slight variations in vocabulary.

I think the main difference is in whether they're affirmative or negative statements. Clause 1 uses ""may"" which is a positive conditional (""May""), while Clause 2 uses ""may not"" (""Can't""). This means one allows and the other disallows the action mentioned.

Also, both clauses mention that to the extent POSCO Affiliates make sales, POSCO Power either agrees or doesn't agree. That part seems consistent except for the subject of agreement: in Clause 1 it's ""may furnish copies,"" while in Clause 2 it's ""does not agree to furnish."" The verb is also different: ""agrees"" vs. ""does not agree.""

So putting it together, both clauses are making a conditional statement about the audit procedure and its consequences based on POSCO Power's sales. However, they differ slightly in form and vocabulary regarding whether they're allowing or disallowing the action.

I think that makes them different in structure, even though the content is similar. The main point of difference is the use of ""may"" vs. ""may not."" So yes, these clauses are different.
</think>

Okay, so I have to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through each clause carefully.

Starting with Clause 1: It says that FCE may, at its expense, audit royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year. The audit is conducted by designated independent public accountants. Then, it mentions that if any sales are made by POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power agrees to provide copies of relevant books and records for the audit by FCE.

Clause 2: FCE is entitled at its own cost to conduct an annual audit of royalty amounts declared by POSCO. The audit is done by independent public accountants chosen by FCE. If any transactions are through POSCO Affiliates, POSCO commits to providing FCE with copies of pertinent records. The reason for giving these documents seems to be facilitating the audit.

So both clauses mention FCE conducting an annual audit of royalty amounts, and that if there's a sale or transaction via affiliate, they have to provide some books or records. The difference lies in the first clause where it specifically mentions ""at its expense"" for the audit. That makes me think of the cost aspect: perhaps the fee required is separate.

In Clause 2, it's stated as ""at its own cost,"" which might mean that FCE can pay to have someone else do the audit instead of them doing it themselves. But in Clause 1, ""at its expense"" suggests a direct financial obligation or cost for FCE to conduct it, rather than being out of their own money.

So the main difference is whether the fee for conducting the audit is within FCE's control (its own cost) or if they have to pay something (expense). This could affect compliance and legal interpretations regarding who bears the cost of the audit.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they are different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""At its expense, FCE may, by its designated independent public accountants, audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year."" That's the first part. Then it goes on: ""To the extent any sales are made by any POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power agrees to furnish to FCE copies of relevant books and records of the POSCO Affiliates for the sole purpose of such audit by FCE.""

Clause 2 is almost the same in structure but with some key differences. It says: ""At its expense, FCE may not, by its designated independent public accountants, audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year."" So here, instead of saying ""may"", it says ""may not"". Then, in the second part: ""To the extent any sales are made by any POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power does not agree to furnish to FCE copies of relevant books and records... for the sole purpose of such audit by FCE.""

Hmm. So, let's break this down. The first clause is allowing FCE to audit the royalties reported by POSCO Power once a year through their auditors. Additionally, it requires POSCO Power to provide books and records from their affiliates if any sales were made, solely for the purpose of this audit.

In Clause 2, the first part says ""may not"" instead of ""may."" So that's a clear difference. It prohibits FCE from auditing the royalties. That's different from allowing them to do so once a year.

The second part also changes: instead of agreeing to provide copies, it states that POSCO Power does not agree. So, they refuse to furnish the records for the audit.

So both clauses are about FCE wanting to audit and get access to records related to POSCO Affiliates' sales. But Clause 1 is permissive—FCE can do so once a year—and POSCO Power must comply with providing necessary documents. Clause 2 is restrictive: FCE cannot audit, and POSCO Power won't provide the documents.

Therefore, the two clauses are different because one allows and requires an audit, while the other prohibits it entirely.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read both clauses carefully and see what they're saying.

Clause 1: It says that FCE may, at its expense, audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year. The auditing is done by FCE's designated independent public accountants. Additionally, if any sales are made by POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power has to provide copies of relevant books and records for the sole purpose of such audit.

Clause 2: It states that FCE is entitled to conduct an annual audit of the royalty amounts declared by POSCO Power at its own cost. This audit is done by independent public accountants chosen by FCE. Moreover, if there are transactions by POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power must provide FCE with copies of pertinent books and records, solely for facilitating the audit.

Now, I'll break down each part to see if they're equivalent or not.

First, in Clause 1, it's stated that FCE ""may"" audit, which implies some discretion. In Clause 2, it says FCE is ""entitled,"" which suggests a right or obligation. So there's a difference here: one uses ""may,"" the other ""is entitled."" However, the context might still lead them to mean the same thing because both allow FCE to audit.

Next, the frequency of the audit: Clause 1 specifies ""no more than once a year,"" while Clause 2 just says ""annual audit."" They seem equivalent since an annual audit implies doing it once a year.

Regarding who conducts the audit, both clauses specify that independent public accountants are involved. The wording is similar, so no difference here.

Regarding the books and records: Both require POSCO Power to provide copies when there are sales or transactions by Affiliates. The wording in both is about providing for the audit's purpose, so same intent.

Looking at the purposes: Clause 1 says it's ""for the sole purpose of such audit,"" while Clause 2 says it's ""to facilitate the aforementioned audit."" Both mean the documents are only meant to help conduct the audit, so no difference in meaning.

Cost is another point. Clause 1 says FCE may do this at its expense, whereas Clause 2 states that FCE is entitled to do it at its own cost. The terms ""expense"" and ""cost"" are synonyms here, so no difference in meaning.

Putting it all together, despite some slight wording differences (like ""may"" vs. ""entitled,"" ""at its expense"" vs. ""at its own cost""), the overall intention and meaning seem to align. Both clauses grant FCE the right and responsibility to audit royalties annually through their chosen auditors and require POSCO Power to provide necessary documents for this purpose.

I don't see any significant differences that would change the legal meaning, so I think they are the same.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 says that at its expense, FCE may use their designated independent public accountants to audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year. Additionally, if any sales are made by any POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power agrees to give FCE copies of relevant books and records for the purpose of that audit.

Clause 2 is similar but with some key differences. It starts by saying that FCE may NOT, at its expense, use their accountants to audit the royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year. Then it says that to the extent any sales are made by any POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power does NOT agree to provide FCE with copies of those books and records for the audit.

So, breaking this down: Clause 1 allows FCE to audit up to once a year and requires POSCO Power to share their affiliate's records. Clause 2 explicitly states that FCE cannot do the audit and also that POSCO Power won't provide the necessary documents. The use of ""may"" in Clause 1 is affirmative, while ""may not"" in Clause 2 is negative. Similarly, the agreement to furnish records in Clause 1 becomes a refusal in Clause 2.

Therefore, these clauses are directly opposing each other. One grants permission and requires cooperation, while the other denies both. So they can't have the same meaning.

Clause 1 says that at its expense, FCE may use its designated independent public accountants to audit royalty amounts reported by POSCO Power no more than once a year. It also states that if any sales are made by POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power agrees to provide copies of relevant books and records for the sole purpose of this audit.

Clause 2 mentions that FCE is entitled at its own cost to conduct an annual audit using independent public accountants chosen by them. Additionally, if transactions occur with POSCO Affiliates, POSCO Power must give FCE pertinent books and records, which are solely for facilitating the audit.

Comparing both clauses:

- Both mention that FCE conducts audits at their expense, either ""at its own cost"" or ""at its expense.""
- The frequency is annual in both: once a year and annual audit.
- The auditors are independent public accountants chosen by FCE.
- Both require POSCO Power to provide books and records from Affiliates if there are sales (Clause 1) or transactions (Clause 2). ""Sales"" vs. ""transactions"" might be slightly different, but likely cover the same scope in context.
- The purpose is the same: solely for FCE's audit.

The only minor difference is the wording around who designates the accountants and whether it's sales or transactions. However, these differences don't change the overall meaning, so I think they are essentially the same.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them again.

Clause 1 says that the Landlord has the right at reasonable times during business hours through their agents to inspect and copy all records and books of accounts. 

Clause 2 states that they **cannot** be entitled to do the same.

Hmm, at first glance, both clauses seem similar but one is a positive right and the other negative. I should check if ""at all reasonable times"" can mean different things here. The word ""all"" might imply a more extensive scope, maybe covering more or different aspects than just copying records.

Wait, ""through Landlord’s duly authorized agents"" suggests they have authorization, but that doesn't change the nature of the right or restriction. So the difference is in whether they are allowed to do the actions and if there's an exception like not being allowed at all reasonable times.

I think the key here is whether the negative applies universally or just sometimes. The first clause uses ""at all,"" which implies that even when they're not authorized, it still applies. But the second one says ""cannot be entitled to do"" without specifying exceptions, so maybe it's more absolute in its restriction.

So overall, I think they are different because one allows and the other disallows under broader terms.

Clause 1 says: Landlord shall be entitled at all reasonable times during business hours through Landlord’s agents, attorneys, accountants to inspect and make copies of any and all such records and books of accounts. So it's talking about the landlord being able to request inspections by their agents. 

Clause 2 is: The Landlord's Right of Inspection. That sounds similar but maybe a bit more formal or technical.

I think both clauses are saying that the landlord can inspect and copy records during reasonable times. But ""right of inspection"" might imply an obligation or a legal right rather than being entitled by request. Maybe in some places, ""right of inspection"" is used differently than just claiming it through agents.

Wait, but I'm not sure if they're the same. They both seem to express the landlord's authority over inspecting records. So do they mean the same thing? Or is there a nuance?

I guess both are about the landlord having the right or authority during certain times. Maybe in some jurisdictions, ""right of inspection"" is used more specifically than ""at all reasonable times."" But overall, I think they're comparable in meaning.

Comparing them, both clauses allow the Landlord to inspect and copy documents through their authorized agents. They both mention ""reasonable times"" and ""business hours."" The difference might be in wording: Clause 1 uses ""duly authorized agents, attorneys, or accountants,"" while Clause 2 lists them as ""agents, lawyers, or accountants."" Also, the structure is slightly different—Clause 1 starts with ""entitled to inspect..."" whereas Clause 2 starts by stating it's a Right of Inspection.

However, both clauses essentially grant the same authority. They specify that the inspection can be done during business hours and through authorized personnel. The terms used are synonymous, so the meaning seems consistent.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Landlord shall be entitled at all reasonable times during business hours, through Landlord’s duly authorized agents, attorneys, or accountants, to inspect and make copies of any and all such records and books of account.""

Clause 2 is almost the same but starts with ""shall not be entitled."" So it reads: ""Landlord shall not be entitled at all reasonable times during business hours... (same rest)...""

Hmm. The main difference is Clause 1 allows the landlord to inspect, while Clause 2 explicitly says they are not allowed to. One grants permission, the other denies it. That seems pretty clear.

I don't see any other differences except for that one word ""not."" Everything else is identical in both clauses regarding who is doing what and under what circumstances.

So yeah, these two are definitely different because one gives entitlement and the other withdraws it.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read both of them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Landlord shall be entitled at all reasonable times during business hours, through Landlord’s duly authorized agents, attorneys, or accountants, to inspect and make copies of any and all such records and books of account.""

Clause 2 is titled ""Landlord's Right of Inspection"" and states: ""The Landlord, either personally or through their authorized representatives, including agents, lawyers, or accountants, may access and duplicate any and all such records and accounting books at any reasonable time during normal business hours.""

First, I'll break down the key elements in each clause.

In Clause 1:
- The landlord is entitled to inspect and copy records.
- This can be done through authorized agents, attorneys, or accountants.
- The times are ""all reasonable times during business hours.""
- It mentions ""records and books of account.""

In Clause 2:
- The landlord may access and duplicate records.
- They can do this personally or through authorized representatives like agents, lawyers, or accountants.
- The timing is ""any reasonable time during normal business hours.""
- The items are ""records and accounting books.""

Now, comparing the two:

1. **Scope of Access**: Both clauses allow the landlord to access records either directly or through representatives. Clause 1 specifies ""duly authorized agents,"" while Clause 2 uses ""authorized representatives, including..."" So they're essentially saying the same thing about who can act on behalf of the landlord.

2. **Timing**: Both mention reasonable times during business hours. Clause 1 says ""at all reasonable times,"" and Clause 2 says ""any reasonable time."" These phrases are very similar in meaning, just phrased slightly differently.

3. **Action Permitted**: Clause 1 allows inspecting and making copies, while Clause 2 uses ""access and duplicate."" Access includes inspecting, and duplicating is another term for making copies. So the actions allowed seem identical.

4. **Records Mentioned**: Clause 1 refers to ""records and books of account,"" whereas Clause 2 mentions ""records and accounting books."" These phrases are just alternative ways of referring to the same types of documents.

Looking at all these points, both clauses appear to convey the same rights for the landlord regarding inspection and copying of records. The wording is slightly different but conveys the same意思.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Allow Bank, or its agents, at reasonable times, on three (3) Business Day’s notice (provided no notice is required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to inspect and audit and copy Borrower’s Books. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Borrower’s expense.""

Clause 2: ""Allow Bank, or its agents, at reasonable times, on three (3) Business Day’s notice (provided no notice is required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to inspect and audit and copy Borrower’s Books. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Allow Bank's expense.""

Hmm, so both clauses are stating the same thing in a bit different ways. They seem to have similar wording except for a minor difference: ""Borrower” vs. ""Allow Bank.” That's probably intentional to make them look slightly different. I don't think this makes any legal difference because it's just changing the subject of the sentence.

I should consider what each part means. Both clauses mention allowing certain actions (inspecting, auditing, copying books) at specific times and notice periods. The key part is that the fees for these actions are deducted from the bank's expense or Borrower's own expense. 

Wait, but in Clause 2, it says ""at Allow Bank's expense."" That seems a bit odd because 'allowing' usually means the receiver takes the action with the fee paid to the lender. So if I'm the bank and I allow them to do this inspection without paying their own money (as per their own expense), that doesn't make sense. It would be incorrect.

I think it's a typo or mistake in Clause 2, making it sound more like the bank is taking on the fees from someone else instead of the borrower. So even though they're stating the same actions, the legal implications are different because one is correctly reflecting the financial structure and the other is misleading by changing the subject.

So yes, despite the minor wording differences and perhaps a typo, these clauses likely have the same meaning but differ in style.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Allow Bank, or its agents, at reasonable times, on three (3) Business Day’s notice...to inspect and audit and copy Borrower’s Books."" It adds that no notice is needed if there's an Event of Default ongoing. The phrase here is ""three (3) Business Day’s notice.""

Clause 2 says: ""Permit the Bank or its representatives to examine, audit, and duplicate the Borrower's records...unless an Event of Default has transpired and persists, in which case no notice is necessary."" It also mentions similar details about timing and purpose, but with a focus on ""Event of Default"" instead of ""Event of Default has occurred.""

Hmm. So both clauses mention allowing the bank to inspect, audit, and duplicate records. They both use ""Bank or its agents"" and set a notice period. The key difference seems to be how they describe when the notice is required.

Clause 1 says no notice is needed if an Event of Default continues. Clause 2 refers specifically to ""transierces,"" which might be a misspelling? Or perhaps it's an intentional error? Also, both clauses mention conducting inspections at the Borrower's expense or cost.

Wait, maybe that's not the main difference. Both seem to require a notice for the period before the inspection. The issue is whether ""three (3) Business Day’s notice"" is the same as ""three Business Days notice."" In law, especially in legal documents and contracts, timing terms are case-sensitive because of how they're used.

So, if both clauses mention the same time frame but use slightly different phrases, does that make them different? Or is it just a grammatical variation?

I think they might be considered the same for all intents and purposes. The differences in wording don't change the meaning. They're essentially saying the same thing: allow the bank to inspect on a three-day notice period without any cost or expense unless an Event of Default continues, in which case no notice is needed.

So I'm leaning towards them being the same.

Okay, so I have two legal clauses here, and I need to figure out if they mean the same thing or not. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Borrower’s expense."" So that means the borrower will pay for the inspections and audits done by the bank or its agents.

Clause 2 says: ""The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Allow Bank's expense."" Hmm, wait a second. The wording here is slightly different. In Clause 1, it's ""Borrower’s Books"" being inspected, but in Clause 2, it's just ""the foregoing inspections and audits,"" which refers back to the same actions as in Clause 1. However, the crucial difference is who is paying for them.

Clause 1 specifies that the borrower pays, while Clause 2 says Allow Bank's expense. Now, I need to check if ""Allow Bank"" is the same as the first party mentioned. In both clauses, it starts with ""Allow Bank,"" so perhaps that's the name of the bank involved. So in Clause 1, the expenses are on the borrower, and in Clause 2, on Allow Bank.

Wait, but does that make sense? If the bank is charging the borrower, then allowing the bank to inspect would mean the borrower pays. But if it's Allow Bank paying their own expenses, maybe they're the ones covering it. So both clauses allow the bank or agents to inspect with three business days notice, without needing prior notice in case of a default.

The difference is who pays for the inspections and audits. Clause 1 says Borrower’s expense, while Clause 2 says Allow Bank's expense. So if I were the borrower, being told that the bank can audit me at my expense in Clause 1 would mean I have to pay. But in Clause 2, it's saying the bank will pay for their own audits, so perhaps they're covering it.

Therefore, these clauses are different because one makes the borrower responsible for costs, and the other shifts it to the bank. So the answer should be ""Different"".

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read through both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by saying that the Bank or its agents can inspect and audit the Borrower's books with a reasonable notice period of three business days. It also mentions that this notice isn't required if there's an Event of Default happening. The inspections are at the Borrower's expense.

Clause 2 is similar but worded slightly differently. It says ""Permit the Bank or its representatives to examine, audit, and duplicate the Borrower's records"" upon a three-day notice, unless an Event of Default has occurred. Again, it notes that no notice is needed in that case and that the costs are on the Borrower.

Looking at the structure, both clauses grant the Bank the right to inspect and audit the books with a three-day notice. The first part of each clause is quite similar in content. However, I should check for differences in wording or implications.

In Clause 1, it says ""inspect and audit and copy Borrower’s Books."" It uses ""copy"" explicitly, while Clause 2 says ""examine, audit, and duplicate the Borrower's records,"" using ""duplicate"" instead of ""copy."" That might be a difference in terminology but not necessarily in meaning since ""copy"" and ""duplicate"" can be considered synonymous.

Also, both clauses mention that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, notice isn't required. That part is identical in wording between the two clauses.

Another point is the cost: Clause 1 says it's at the Borrower's expense, and so does Clause 2. No difference there either.

Looking deeper, the structure of the sentences is almost identical. Both start with a permission granted to the Bank or its agents/representatives, followed by the same conditions regarding notice and default events. The activities (inspect, audit) are the same in both clauses.

So, even though they use slightly different synonyms like ""copy"" vs. ""duplicate,"" the meaning remains consistent. There's no variation in the notice period, the condition for no notice, or the cost structure.

I don't see any significant differences that would change the meaning. Therefore, these two clauses have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 are the same or different. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says that the borrower must allow the bank or its agents to inspect, audit, and copy their books with three business days' notice unless there's an event of default. It also mentions that these inspections and audits will be at the borrower's expense.

Clause 2 is almost identical except for one part. It also allows the bank or agents to do the same actions under similar conditions but states that the inspections are at the bank's expense instead of the borrower's.

So, the main difference here is who is responsible for covering the costs. In Clause 1, the borrower pays, while in Clause 2, the bank covers the expenses. That seems like a significant change because it affects the financial responsibilities of each party involved.

I think that's enough to say they're different because the cost burden shifts from one party to another.

Looking at the key points:

- Both allow inspection by the Bank or its agents/representatives.
- The notice period is the same: 3 Business Days, except during an Event of Default.
- Both require the Borrower to cover the costs of these inspections.
- Clause 1 mentions ""Books"" while Clause 2 refers to ""records."" I think ""Books"" here likely means financial records or books, which aligns with ""records.""
- The actions allowed are similar: inspect, audit, copy vs. examine, audit, duplicate. These seem equivalent in meaning.

I don't see any significant differences in the permissions granted or the conditions under which they apply. So it looks like both clauses are expressing the same rights and obligations.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them again.

Clause 1 starts by saying the Borrower needs to allow any authorized reps from a Lender to visit properties for inspections. It mentions inspecting financial and accounting records, copying extracts, discussing matters with officers, independent accountants, and that out-of-pocket expenses are due by the Borrower. 

Clause 2 is identical except it ends with ""the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Lenders"" instead of ""The Borrower."" Wait, no, actually looking again: Clause 1 says ""The reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Lenders..."" and Clause 2 uses ""the Borrower."" That's a different wording.

Hmm, so both clauses are talking about same general things: borrowing properties, visiting for inspections, handling financial records. The main difference is in what each party expects to pay. The Lenders on one side expect their out-of-pocket costs to be paid by the Borrower, while on the other side, it's the Borrower that covers these expenses through reasonable notice and times.

I think ""Lenders"" versus ""Borrower"" are just different parties here, not a difference in what they're paying. The key actions are the same: allowing inspections, copying records, discussing matters, paying out-of-pocket costs to the Borrower either directly or through their reasonable expectation of payment.

So, the main differences are the names used (Lenders vs Borrower) and who is responsible for covering the expenses. Since these are the same parties in different roles within the agreement, they probably don't have the same meaning in terms of what each party does regarding out-of-pocket costs.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them again carefully.

Clause 1 is in plain English with a lot of words and conditions about representatives visiting properties, copying extracts from financial records, discussing matters with accountants, and expenses being paid by the Lenders. It ends with ""any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses will be payable by the Borrower.""

Clause 2 seems to have a heading first: **Borrower's Inspection Obligations**. It also lists the same points but starts with that heading instead of stating ""The Borrower shall..."" Then it says ""Any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lenders in connection with such inspections will be the responsibility of the Borrower to reimburse.""

So, both clauses start similarly. The first clause is more detailed about responsibilities and payments, while the second starts by talking about obligations under the title ""Borrower's Inspection Obligations."" 

I think the main difference might be that Clause 2 uses a different structure with a heading, but the content seems identical. Since they both cover the same requirements and obligations regarding Lenders' expenses, I don't see them as different. They just have slightly varying wording in how it's presented.

Clause 2: Same structure as Clause 1.

Again, the Borrower must cover the Lenders' expenses from such inspections.

Looking closely, both clauses have identical wording. They mention exactly the same points: visiting properties, inspecting financial records, discussing affairs, all within reasonable notice and hours, and the Borrower paying for the Lenders' expenses.

I don't see any differences in wording or meaning between them. The structure is identical, so they must be saying the exact same thing.

All this needs reasonable notice and during normal business hours. Also, the Borrower has to pay for any out-of-pocket expenses.

Clause 2 is titled ""Borrower's Inspection Obligations."" It says the Borrower agrees to allow representatives appointed by a Lender to enter and examine properties.

Comparing the two, Clause 1 uses ""permit"" while Clause 2 says ""allow."" That might be a slight difference in wording but conveys the same idea. Both mention inspections of properties and access to financial records. They both allow discussion with officers and accountants. The notice and timing requirements are identical. The part about expenses is also identical—Borrower must cover them.

The wording is slightly different—Clause 1 uses ""visit and inspect,"" while Clause 2 says ""enter and examine."" But these phrases mean the same thing in context. Similarly, copying versus duplicating or extracting information are interchangeable here.

Both clauses mention financial and accounting records being accessible, and discussions with officers and accountants about affairs, finances, and accounts. The timing is the same: reasonable notice during normal business hours. Expense reimbursement is also identical.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's take them one by one.

First up is Mosaic having the right to inspect and copy records. The clause says ""have the right to inspect such records from time to time and to make copies of such records."" That sounds like they can both inspect and copy, but not necessarily that they're obligated to do both every single time. It's more about the right to do each activity separately.

Then there's Clause 2: Mosaic has no right to inspect nor to make copies. This seems stricter. Instead of having a right to both activities each time, it's outright stating that they don't have any right at all in either. So it's not just a right; it's an impossibility. They can't even perform one part.

So comparing them, Clause 1 allows for the right to inspect and copy separately, but doesn't prevent either from being done every time. Clause 2 outright denies both rights completely. Therefore, they are different because in the second case, neither action is possible.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses about Mosaic's rights are the same or different. Let me read them again carefully.

Clauses 1 says: ""Mosaic shall have the right to inspect such records from time to time and to make copies of such records."" The phrase here is ""shall have the right"" followed by two actions: inspecting records and making copies. 

Clauses 2 translates to: ""Mosaic is entitled to periodically review these records and create duplicates as necessary."" Here, it's a bit more wordy with ""is entitled"" instead of ""have the right,"" but both suggest Mosaic has a duty or right to perform certain actions.

The main difference I can see is in the structure. The first clause uses ""shall have the right"" which might imply a duty that requires action unless prohibited, whereas the second one uses ""is entitled to."" Both imply that Mosaic can inspect and copy records periodically, but their phrasing is slightly different. So they're not the same because of these structural differences in meaning.

First, looking at Clause 1: It says that Mosaic ""shall have the right"" to inspect records from time to time and make copies of such records. So this is granting Mosaic a specific permission or authority to do these actions.

Then Clause 2 flips that around. It states that Mosaic ""shall have no right"" to inspect records nor to make copies. This seems to be denying any rights they might have had before, effectively revoking the permission granted in Clause 1.

So at first glance, one is granting a right and the other is taking it away. They are opposites in terms of granting or denying access and copying. Therefore, their meanings are different because one allows the action and the other prohibits it.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let's take it step by step.

First, Clause 1 says that Mosaic ""shall have the right to inspect such records from time to time and to make copies of such records."" The key words here are ""inspect"" and ""make copies."" It sounds like they can do this whenever they want, as long as it's necessary or allowed by some agreement.

Now, Clause 2 says Mosaic is ""entitled to periodically review these records and create duplicates as necessary."" Here, the terms used are ""periodically review"" and ""create duplicates as necessary."" The word ""periodically"" suggests a regular schedule, like every week or month. Also, they mention creating duplicates, which I'm not entirely sure about—does that mean making copies or perhaps backing them up in a specific way?

Comparing the two clauses: both grant Mosaic some form of access to records, either for inspection or review. Both allow them to make copies or create duplicates as needed. However, there's a difference in the terminology and the specifics. Clause 1 uses ""inspect"" which is more general, while Clause 2 specifies ""review"" and adds the concept of creating duplicates.

I'm a bit confused about whether creating duplicates is the same as making copies. In legal terms, duplicates might refer to creating additional records for processing or archiving, whereas making copies could mean something similar but perhaps in a different context. So maybe they are related but not exactly the same.

Also, the timing aspect—Clause 1 mentions doing this ""from time to time,"" which could be more flexible, while Clause 2 uses ""periodically,"" implying a set schedule. This difference might affect how often Mosaic can access the records.

So, considering these points, even though both clauses give Mosaic rights related to accessing and copying records, the specifics—like the method of creating duplicates versus making copies, and the timing—are different enough that they might not be entirely interchangeable in meaning.

First, looking at Clause 1: ""Mosaic shall have the right to inspect such records from time to time and to make copies of such records."" So this is giving Mosaic permission to check the records whenever they want and also copy them. It sounds like they're allowed access and duplication rights.

Now, Clause 2 says: ""Mosaic shall have no right to inspect records from time to time nor to make copies of such records."" This seems pretty straightforward as well but it's saying the opposite. Mosaic doesn't have the permission to look at the records or copy them. So where Clause 1 grants rights, Clause 2 explicitly denies them.

I should consider if there's any overlap or nuance I might be missing. The first clause is about having rights, the second about lacking those same rights. There's no ambiguity here; one allows access and copying, the other prohibits it entirely.

So yeah, these two clauses are definitely different because they're conveying opposite permissions regarding Mosaic's ability to inspect and copy records.

Clause 1 says: ""Mosaic shall have the right to inspect such records from time to time and to make copies of such records."" 

Clause 2 states: ""Mosaic is entitled to periodically review these records and create duplicates as necessary.""

Alright, let's break this down. Both clauses are talking about Mosaic having some rights regarding records.

In Clause 1, it mentions the ""right"" to inspect records from time to time and make copies. The words here are ""inspect,"" ""from time to time,"" and ""make copies."" 

Clause 2 uses slightly different wording: ""entitled to periodically review these records"" and ""create duplicates as necessary."" So, instead of ""inspect,"" it says ""review."" Instead of ""from time to time,"" it's ""periodically."" And instead of ""make copies,"" it's ""create duplicates.""

Now, let me think about the synonyms here. ""Inspect"" and ""review"" are pretty similar in this context—they both mean looking at something for verification or examination. ""From time to time"" versus ""periodically""—both imply regular but not necessarily fixed intervals. And ""make copies"" vs. ""create duplicates as necessary""—both refer to producing additional copies, with the second one adding a condition of necessity.

So, each term in Clause 1 seems to have an equivalent in Clause 2. The structure is slightly different, but the meanings align closely. They both grant Mosaic the authority to access and reproduce records at regular intervals as needed.

I don't see any significant differences in what they're allowing Mosaic to do. Both are granting rights related to accessing and copying records. So, I think these clauses are essentially saying the same thing, just using different wording.

deepseek-r1:1.5b,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine if these two clauses are the same or different. 

First, I'll look at the structure of each clause. Both start by saying ""Licensor and its representatives may upon fourteen days... audit said books..."" So that seems identical.

Next, they both state that all audits should be at Licensor's expense. That part is exactly the same in both clauses.

Then, the exceptions are slightly different. In Clause 1, it says if the audit reveals that the company (Licensor) is entitled to payments equal to $5,000 or more in addition to what was previously paid by the Licensee to Licensor. It mentions ""more than five percent"" as a threshold. 

In Clause 2, the wording changes slightly: it says if the audit reveals that Licensor is entitled to payments equal to $5,000 or more... and also ""licensee has underpaid royalties to Licensor by more than five percent."" 

I notice that both clauses mention the Licensee not being able to repay a certain amount plus interest. But one clause refers to it as ""amount due plus interest,"" while the other says ""amount due in accordance with paragraph 8 above"" and ""pay all costs of the audit.""

Wait, paragraph 8 wasn't provided, but assuming that's about specific rules or policies related to audits, I think that part is similar. So in both cases, if the conditions are met, the Licensee won't repay plus interest.

Comparing the exceptions: Clause 1 explicitly states a 5% increase on previously paid royalties as an exception. Clause 2 refers to it as a ""royalty"" and mentions a 5% underpayment threshold without specifying whether it's on payments or royalties. 

So, in Clause 2, it's not clear from the text which parties are being referred to for the royalty amount. That ambiguity might make the exceptions slightly different.

Additionally, Clause 1 specifies that if the company is entitled to more money than before, then the Licensee can't pay interest on the amount due. In Clause 2, they mention both conditions: the increase and the underpayment of royalties. 

This makes me think the exceptions are not entirely identical because one explicitly mentions a payment threshold and the other mentions a royalty threshold but doesn't specify which. That could make them slightly different in meaning.

So, after considering all parts, I would say that the clauses have some similarities but differ in how they phrase the conditions under which the Licensee must repay plus interest during an audit.

Clause 1 starts by mentioning ""Licensor and its representatives may upon fourteen days prior..."" So that's clear about the deadline being 14 days before.

Then it says during usual business hours to audit their books of account and records, making copies at the Licensor's expense. That sounds straightforward: they can do an audit while open, covering costs with themselves.

Next, if the audit finds two things: either the licensor is owed $5k or more in additional payments compared to what was previously paid by the licensee to them. Or the licensee underpaid royalties by more than five percent in a quarter—then the licensee has to pay back the due amount plus interest, and also bear all costs of the audit.

Clause 2 is titled ""Inspection Rights and Obligations."" It says Licensor can review accounts after a written notification at least 14 days before. That's similar to clause 1 about the deadline. The review must be during business hours; copies are made at Licensor's cost.

Generally, the licensor covers all audit expenses, but if certain conditions (i) or (ii) are met, the licensee is responsible for reimbursement and interest on outstanding amounts, plus costs related to the audit.

So both clauses mention the same things: a 14-day notice before the review can happen, during business hours. The key difference is that in clause 2, it's part of an inspection rights section, whereas clause 1 explicitly mentions the auditing process and specific repayment conditions for the licensee. 

Clause 1 is more about the audit procedure (licensor paying for themselves) while clause 2 is about the right to inspect books (an inspection right), which is broader. So they're not the same because one talks specifically about audits by the licensor, and the other covers a broader right of inspection.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll read both clauses carefully to understand their structure and content.

Clause 1 says that the Licensor can audit the Licensee's books upon 14 days' written notice during usual business hours, at Licensor's expense. It also states that all audits are at Licensor's expense unless certain conditions are met. Specifically, if the audit reveals that the Licensor is entitled to payments of $5,000 or more beyond what was already paid by the Licensee, or if there's an underpayment of royalties by more than 5% in a quarter, then the Licensee has to repay the amount due plus interest and also cover the costs of the audit.

Clause 2 starts with almost identical language as Clause 1. It says that the Licensor may not audit the books upon 14 days' notice, during usual business hours, at Licensor's expense. Wait a second, the first part is different here. In Clause 1, it's ""may upon..."", whereas in Clause 2, it's ""may not upon..."". That seems like a significant difference because one allows for audits and the other prohibits them.

But then I notice that both clauses go on to discuss exceptions where the Licensee has to repay if certain conditions are met. In Clause 1, these exceptions result in the Licensee repaying plus audit costs. In Clause 2, the same exceptions lead to the Licensee not repaying and instead covering all costs.

So breaking it down: The main actions mentioned are whether the Licensor can audit (Clause 1) or cannot audit (Clause 2). Then, when they do audit, there's a condition on repayment versus non-repayment.

Wait, but in Clause 1, the initial part is about the Licensors auditing at their expense, and then the exceptions. In Clause 2, the first part says the Licensor may not audit, so they can't perform the audit unless... No, that doesn't make sense because if it's ""may not"", does that mean they cannot audit unless the conditions are met? Or is it a prohibition regardless?

Wait, no. The wording in Clause 2 starts with ""Licensor and its representatives may not upon..."" which sounds like they have the authority to not audit. But then the exception part says if the audit reveals certain issues, the Licensee shall not repay... So maybe the Licensor's action of auditing is prohibited unless those conditions are met.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me parse it again.

Clause 1: Licensor may audit upon notice, at their expense. All audits are at their expense except if (i) or (ii), then Licensee repays plus audit costs.

Clause 2: Licensor and its representatives may not upon fourteen days’ prior written notice... So they may not audit? But then it says ""except that if the audit reveals..."" Wait, but if they may not audit, how can an audit happen? Maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation. Or perhaps it's meant to say that the Licensor has the option to audit, but in this clause, they have the power not to audit unless certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, maybe Clause 2 is trying to say the same thing as Clause 1 but with an opposite condition. For example, if Clause 1 says the Licensor can audit and the Licensee repays under certain circumstances, Clause 2 might be saying that the Licensor cannot audit unless the Licensee repays.

But looking at the exact wording:

Clause 1: ""Licensor and its representatives may upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice... audit... All audits shall be at Licensor’s expense, except that if... then Licensee shall repay...""

Clause 2: ""Licensor and its representatives may not upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice... audit... All audits shall not be at Licensor’s expense, except that if... then Licensee shall not repay...""

So the key difference is in the initial part. Clause 1 says they may audit, and the only exception affects repayment. Clause 2 says they may not audit, but again with exceptions. Wait, this is confusing because both clauses start with a similar structure but with opposite initial verbs: ""may"" vs. ""may not"".

Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me check again.

Clause 1: ""Licensor and its representatives may upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice... audit...""

So they have the permission to audit under certain conditions. The audits are at Licensor's expense except when exceptions apply, in which case Licensee has to repay.

Clause 2: ""Licensor and its representatives may not upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice... audit...""

This seems contradictory because if they may not audit, how can the audit happen? Unless ""may not"" is used differently here. Maybe it's a way of saying that unless certain conditions are met, the audit cannot occur. So perhaps Clause 2 is trying to say that audits will only happen under specific circumstances.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in translation or structure. For example, if a clause says ""may not"" without any exceptions, it would mean audits never happen. But here, after the initial may not, it lists exceptions where the audit leads to repayment.

Wait, but the structure is similar: except that if... then Licensee shall [not] repay...

So in Clause 1: Audits at Licensor's expense unless (i) or (ii), in which case Licensee repays and covers costs.

In Clause 2: Audits not at Licensor's expense unless (i) or (ii), in which case Licensee does not repay and covers costs.

But wait, how can the audit be ""not"" at Licensor's expense? That would mean the Licensee pays for it. But if the initial part says they may not audit, then maybe the audits don't happen unless those conditions are met. So perhaps Clause 2 is a way of saying that the Licensor has to pay for the audit only when certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, perhaps both clauses are trying to say the same thing but with opposite wording, leading to different implications.

But looking deeper, in Clause 1, the initial part allows audits and pays for them unless exceptions apply. In Clause 2, it starts by saying they may not audit, which would mean no audits happen, but then if an audit does happen (despite the ""may not""), the cost shifts to the Licensee.

This is confusing because the initial wording seems contradictory. Maybe there's a better way to parse it.

Alternatively, perhaps Clause 2 is trying to say that the Licensor cannot audit unless certain conditions are met, thereby limiting their ability but allowing for audits under specific circumstances.

Wait, in legal terms, ""may not upon..."" might be a way of saying that the action (auditing) is prohibited except when... So if they may not audit normally, but can do so when certain conditions are met. That would mean the audits only happen if those exceptions apply, and when they do, the costs fall on the Licensee.

So in Clause 1: Audits are allowed by Licensor, at their expense unless (i) or (ii), then Licensee pays.

In Clause 2: Audits are prohibited by Licensor, except when (i) or (ii), in which case they still pay.

Wait, but if the initial is ""may not"", does that mean they can't audit without those conditions? So perhaps both clauses allow for audits only under certain circumstances. But in Clause 1, the cost is on Licensor unless exceptions; in Clause 2, the cost is on Licensee unless exceptions.

Therefore, the main difference is who bears the cost of the audit and what happens when the exceptions apply.

But the initial wording also differs: one allows audits, the other prohibits them. But perhaps both are trying to say that audits can occur under certain conditions but with different financial implications.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the key point is whether the Licensor can audit or not and who pays when they do.

In Clause 1, the default is that Licensor pays for audits. In exceptions, Licensee has to pay.

In Clause 2, the default is thatLicensor cannot audit, but if they do (despite may not), then Licensee pays.

But maybe both clauses are trying to say the same thing: audits occur only when certain conditions are met, and in those cases, the cost falls on the Licensee. But the way it's phrased in Clause 2 seems contradictory because it starts with ""may not"" which would suggest no audits unless exceptions, but then if an audit does happen under exceptions, the costs shift.

Alternatively, perhaps Clause 2 is trying to say that Licensor cannot audit without permission, and when they do get permission (the exceptions), then Licensee has to cover the cost. So in essence, both clauses limit the situations where audits can occur and assign responsibility accordingly.

But I'm not sure if they are actually different or not. It's possible that they mean the same thing but phrased oppositely, leading to similar results.

Another approach: Maybe Clause 1 is about when the Licensor can audit, whereas Clause 2 is about when the Licensee can audit? But no, it's still the same parties.

Alternatively, maybe one clause is in favor of the Licensor paying unless exceptions, while the other shifts the burden to the Licensee unless exceptions. So they might be inverses of each other.

In that case, perhaps they are opposites and not equivalent. Therefore, their legal effect would differ based on who pays when.

So if I'm trying to determine whether these clauses are the same or different, it depends on how the initial may/may not is interpreted. If ""may"" in Clause 1 allows audits at Licensor's expense unless exceptions apply, while ""may not"" in Clause 2 only allows audits when exceptions happen and then costs shift.

Therefore, they might be structured opposites but result in different responsibilities. Hence, their legal impact would differ.

But to answer the question of whether these clauses are equivalent or not, I think they are opposites because one starts with permission while the other starts with prohibition. Therefore, their effects on when audits can happen and who pays would be different.

So, considering all this, the two clauses are not equivalent because they create opposite obligations regarding auditing and payment.
</think>

The two clauses provided are not legally equivalent. 

Clause 1 allows for audits by the Licensor at their expense unless specific exceptions apply, in which case the Licensee is responsible for repayment. Clause 2, however, initially prohibits audits unless certain conditions are met, and if an audit occurs under these conditions, the financial burden shifts to the Licensee.

The key difference lies in their structure and implications:
- **Clause 1** grants the Licensor permission to conduct audits with costs covered by them, except in specific cases.
- **Clause 2** restricts auditing unless exceptions are met, but if an audit does occur under those circumstances, the Licensee is responsible for associated costs.

Thus, while both clauses regulate auditing and financial responsibilities under certain conditions, their structures lead to opposite legal implications.","

Okay, so I need to determine whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or are different. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by stating that the Licensor can audit the Licensee's books with 14 days' notice during business hours at Licensor's expense. It mentions that all audits are at their expense unless specific conditions are met. If the audit shows that Licensor is owed $5,000 or more beyond what's paid, or if there's a significant underpayment of royalties (more than 5% in a quarter), then the Licensee has to repay the amount plus interest and cover the audit costs.

Clause 2 also talks about inspection rights. It says that after a written 14-day notice, Licensor can review books during business hours, with copies made at their expense. The general rule is Licensor covers audit expenses. However, if the audit finds that Licensor is owed an additional $5,000 or more, or if there's underpayment by more than 5% in a quarter, then Licensee has to repay and cover costs.

Looking for differences: In Clause 1, it starts with ""Licensor and its representatives may upon fourteen days’ prior written notice..."" while Clause 2 says ""The Licensor... is allowed to review the books... following a written notification."" The wording seems similar but let me check more carefully.

Clause 1 uses ""audit"" consistently, referring to making copies at their expense. It then states all audits are at Licensor's expense except for specific cases where Licensee has to repay. Clause 2 also mentions copying at the Licensor's cost and that generally, they cover expenses unless certain conditions apply, leading to Licensee repayment.

The structure is almost identical: same notice period (14 days), same reasons for additional costs or underpayment. The only difference might be in how they're phrased—Clause 1 starts with ""Licensor and its representatives may..."" while Clause 2 uses ""is allowed to review."" However, both are granting rights to the Licensor.

I don't see any substantial differences; both clauses grant the same rights, impose the same conditions, and result in the same consequences for the Licensee. Therefore, they likely have the same meaning.

Alright, let's see. I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or are different. So first, I'll read both carefully.

Clause 1 says that Licensor can audit the books after giving 14 days' notice, and this is done during usual business hours at Licensor’s expense. But there's an exception: if the audit finds that either Licensor is owed $5,000 or more in additional payments, or Licensee underpaid by more than 5% in a quarter, then Licensee has to repay the amount plus interest and cover all audit costs.

Now, looking at Clause 2. It starts with ""Licensor and its representatives may not..."" So that's a negation right there. Instead of allowing audits, it says they cannot perform them upon giving notice during business hours at their own expense. Then it continues: All audits shall NOT be at Licensor’s expense. The exception is similar— if the audit shows underpayment, then Licensee doesn't have to repay plus interest and pay all costs.

Wait a minute. Clause 2 seems like it's stating the opposite of Clause 1 in several parts. For example, where Clause 1 says ""may"" and that audits are at Licensor’s expense except for certain cases, Clause 2 flips that by saying they ""may not"" audit unless... but actually, reading further, it's not even allowing the audits under normal circumstances.

So putting this together, Clause 1 grants permission for audits under certain conditions, with cost responsibilities depending on findings. Clause 2 is prohibiting audits except in cases where Licensee has to cover costs when there's a significant underpayment. That means the rights and obligations here are opposite. One allows audits with specific expenses, while the other restricts audits unless certain conditions are met.

Therefore, these clauses have different meanings because they set up opposing scenarios regarding who can audit and who is responsible for costs.

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I need to determine whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. The user wants a response of either ""Same,"" ""Different,"" or ""Unsure."" So, my job is to analyze both clauses carefully.

First, I'll read through each clause to understand their content and structure. 

Starting with Clause 1: It talks about the Licensor and its representatives having the right to audit the Licensee's books and records upon giving 14 days' written notice during usual business hours. The audits are at the Licensor's expense, except in two specific cases where the Licensee has to cover the costs. Those exceptions are if the audit shows either that the Licensor is owed $5,000 or more beyond what was paid, or if the underpayment of royalties exceeds 5% in a calendar quarter. In such cases, the Licensee must repay the amount plus interest and also pay all audit costs.

Now looking at Clause 2: It mentions the same rights for the Licensor to review the books and records with written notice given at least 14 days in advance, during regular business hours. The copies made are at the Licensor's cost. Generally, audits are covered by the Licensor, but if the audit finds either an additional amount owed of $5,000 or more beyond previous payments, or underpayment of royalties exceeding 5% in any calendar quarter, then the Licensee has to reimburse the outstanding amount with interest and cover all audit costs.

Comparing both clauses, I notice they mention the same parties (Licensor and Licensee), the requirement for 14 days' written notice, audits during business hours, copies at Licensor's expense, exceptions where Licensee covers costs if certain underpayment thresholds are met. The structure is slightly different in wording but conveys the same conditions.

Clause 1 says ""at Licensor’s expense"" except in two cases, while Clause 2 uses ""generally, the Licensor shall cover all audit expenses."" Both specify that exceptions apply when payments owed are $5,000 or more, or underpayment exceeds 5% in a quarter. The repayment includes interest per paragraph 8 and audit costs.

The wording is slightly different—Clause 1 says ""Licensor is entitled to payments equal to Five Thousand Dollars"" while Clause 2 states ""the Licensor is owed an additional sum of Five Thousand Dollars."" But both mean the same thing: if more than $5,000 is owed. Similarly, underpayment by over 5% is a trigger in both.

Therefore, after carefully comparing each part, they seem to convey the exact obligations and conditions without any discrepancies.

Alright, let's try to figure this out. I'm looking at two legal clauses here, Clause 1 and Clause 2, and I need to determine if they mean the same thing or different things.

First, I'll read through both clauses carefully. 

In Clause 1, it says that CIGI must submit to MBI for review or auditing specific forms related to royalties. It also adds that MBI has a right to examine and copy those documents at MBI's expense. Additionally, there's an independent audit request from MBI.

Clause 2 is similar but some parts are changed. The first part talks about CIGI needing not to submit the same things. Then it removes the ""at MBI’s expense"" part and changes the right that MBI has to examine the documents to ""not have."" Also, the independent audit part is gone.

So, comparing both clauses: they seem similar except for some minor phrasings. Clause 1 mentions MBI's expenses, while Clause 2 doesn't mention costs. It also removes the right against an independent audit from MBI in both parts. The main difference is that in the second clause, it explicitly states ""must not submit,"" whereas in the first clause, it just says ""verify."" However, since both clauses require that CIGI must provide certain documents for royalty verification, they essentially convey the same meaning.

Wait, but let me double-check. In Clause 1, there's a part where MBI can request specific forms related to royalties. The second part of the clause says MBI has a right to have an independent audit made at any time. Clause 2 changes that to ""MBI shall not have the right"" and removes the cost mention entirely.

So, in terms of intent, both clauses are about CIGI needing to verify royalties without submitting certain documents, but they differ in which specific rights MBI has. In Clause 1, it's at MBI's expense, and in Clause 2, it's not allowed by MBI even if they ask.

So overall, the main differences are in the phrasing of the rights against MBI for review or auditing (the cost part) and whether CIGI is required to submit these forms. Both clauses require that CIGI provide specific documents but differ in which rights apply. Therefore, they might not be identical because the rights involved are slightly different.
</think>

Different","

Different","<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me start by reading through both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""CIGI shall submit to MBI..."" and mentions specific actions like reviewing or auditing other forms, reports, records, etc., for verifying royalties. Then it says that MBI has a right to examine and copy these documents at MBI's expense. After that, MBI has the right to audit CIGI's books at any time.

Clause 2 begins similarly with ""CIGI is required to provide MBI..."" about additional documents. It says that MBI can inspect and duplicate CIGI's records, with costs possibly going to MBI. It also mentions that MBI retains a right to audit CIGI's books.

Comparing both clauses, they seem very similar in structure. Both mention the requirement for CIGI to provide information to MBI, the nature of this information (submissions or additional documents), and the rights MBI has regarding examination and duplication. The only difference I can see is that Clause 1 mentions ""MBI's expense"" while Clause 2 just says costs are ""believed"" to go to MBI. However, in legal contexts, saying something is at expense usually means it's covered by the party's liability insurance or a separate agreement. Since both clauses talk about costs being with MBI, I think they are intended to convey the same meaning.

I also need to consider if ""at MBI's expense"" and ""believed that costs will be with MBI"" could imply different things. But in this context, without specific terms like insurance or liability, it's probably safe to say they're the same. Both indicate that CIGI is responsible for paying the costs after MBI does the work.

So, putting it all together, I think these clauses are structurally similar and convey the same legal meaning. Therefore, they should be classified as ""Same.""

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that CIGI has to submit various documents and information to MBI for review or auditing as requested. It also mentions that MBI can examine and copy CIGI's books, records, and tax returns at their expense. Plus, MBI can request an independent audit of CIGI's books.

Clause 2 is almost the opposite. It states that CIGI doesn't need to submit any forms or reports to MBI for review or auditing. Then it says that MBI or its agents don't have the right to examine and copy those records, and they can't request an independent audit either.

So, looking at the first part of both clauses: Clause 1 requires CIGI to submit information, while Clause 2 says CIGI doesn't need to submit anything. That's a direct contrast.

In Clause 1, MBI is granted rights to examine and copy records and conduct audits. In Clause 2, those same rights are explicitly denied. So both clauses are addressing the same subject matter but with opposing requirements.

Therefore, it looks like they have different meanings. Clause 1 imposes obligations on CIGI and grants powers to MBI, whereas Clause 2 removes those obligations and denies those powers.
</think>

Okay, so I have to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says that CIGI has to submit ""such other forms, reports, records, information, and data"" that MBI may reasonably request for verifying royalty calculations. Then it goes on to say that MBI or its agents can examine and copy books, records, and tax returns at MBI's expense. Also, MBI can have an independent audit of CIGI's books.

Clause 2 states that CIGI must provide MBI with any additional documents, reports, etc., that MBI might reasonably request to verify royalties. It also mentions that MBI or its designated persons are entitled to inspect and duplicate CIGI's books and records, with costs borne by MBI. Additionally, MBI has the right to conduct an independent audit of CIGI's books at any time.

Comparing both clauses: Both require CIGI to provide documents for royalty verification. Both allow MBI or their agents to inspect and copy CIGI's records, with MBI covering costs. Both also grant MBI the power to do independent audits. The wording is pretty similar in structure and intent.

However, I notice that Clause 1 uses ""verify the calculation of royalties payable,"" while Clause 2 says ""verify the calculation of royalties owed."" ""Payable"" and ""owed"" might imply different things—royalties payable suggests an obligation to pay, whereas royalties owed could be a liability. This could affect the legal interpretation.

Additionally, Clause 1 specifically mentions submitting ""such other forms... as MBI may reasonably request,"" which is slightly more general than Clause 2's wording about ""additional documents... that MBI may reasonably request."" But both are about requests from MBI to CIGI for documentation.

In terms of the rights granted: both clauses allow MBI to inspect and copy records, with costs by MBI. Both also include independent audits. So despite the difference in terminology regarding royalties (payable vs. owed), the structure and rights seem similar.

So, considering that they might just be using synonyms for obligations, I think the clauses are saying the same thing.

Clause 1 says that CIGI will submit certain forms and data for MBI's review or auditing. It also mentions that MBI can examine and copy CIGI's books at their expense, and they can have an independent audit done. So, this is giving MBI the rights to access information and audit.

Clause 2 seems to contradict that. It says CIGI does not need to submit those forms, and MBI doesn't have the right to examine or copy the records. Additionally, they can't have an independent audit either. 

So, comparing both clauses, Clause 1 grants rights to MBI, while Clause 2 denies those same rights. They are essentially opposites in terms of what each party is allowed to do. Therefore, these clauses are different.

It also mentions that MBI can examine and copy CIGI's books, records, and tax returns at reasonable times, with MBI covering the costs. Plus, MBI has the right to do an independent audit of CIGI's books whenever they want.

Clause 2 is similar: CIGI must provide any additional documents that MBI reasonably requests for verifying royalties. It says MBI or its designates can inspect and duplicate CIGI's records at reasonable times, with costs on MBI. Also, MBI can conduct an independent audit at any time.

Looking closely, both clauses require CIGI to submit necessary information for royalty verification. They both allow MBI access to examine and copy records, specifying that the cost is borne by MBI. The right for MBI to conduct audits is also present in both, though Clause 1 specifies it can be at any time while Clause 2 says ""at any time"" as well.

The wording differs slightly—like ""submit"" vs. ""provide"", but the meaning seems the same. Both use ""reasonably request,"" and specify that MBI covers the costs. The audit right is consistent too.

I don't see any differences in the rights or obligations described between the two clauses. They both outline the same requirements for CIGI and grant the same access and auditing rights to MBI.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 says that Reseller acknowledges something about a designated representative from NovaCharge who was approved by them. The conditions here are that the approval isn't unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. They mention that this person is authorized to do specific tasks: examine, audit, reproduce copies, and take copies of records required by Reseller under Section 16.

Clause 2 is similar but opposite. It states that the designated representative is not authorized to perform those tasks. The other conditions are the same: no unreasonably withheld approval; during business hours, reasonable intervals; and no more than twice per year.

So both clauses have the same main conditions except for the conclusion about who's allowed or disallowed from performing specific tasks. In Clause 1, it's that they're authorized, and in Clause 2, it's that they're not. The rest of the wording is almost identical except for these two points.

The key difference is whether the designated representative is allowed or prohibited from taking certain actions based on their approval status. Since both clauses reference the same conditions about approval and authorization but opposite conclusions on specific tasks, I think they are different because the outcome varies while the other factors remain consistent.

I don't see any differences in the rest of the clauses that would make them the same except for these two aspects: who is allowed to do what and whether it's an ""allowed"" or ""not allowed"" situation. So overall, the clauses have different outcomes on specific tasks but share most of their conditions.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether two legal clauses are the same or different. I'll need to analyze each clause carefully.

First, looking at Clause 1: Reseller acknowledges that a designated representative from NovaCharge has approved records under Section 16 and can perform certain tasks like examination, audit, reproduction, and copy. It mentions specific conditions on approvals and constraints on how often these tasks might be conducted. 

Clause 2 is titled ""Reseller Affirmation of Audit Rights"" and seems to emphasize the Reseller's right to audit records under Section 16 without needing approval from NovaCharge. It also states that a designated representative has approval, similar to Clause 1.

I notice that both clauses mention the designation by NovaCharge and require the representative's approval. However, the wording in Clause 2 is more direct about the Reseller's right to perform the tasks without additional approvals, while Clause 1 adds constraints on how these tasks can be conducted within a year or not at all.

The key difference lies in the scope of permissions.Clause 2 seems broader, allowing any designated representative for their audit rights and restricting the frequency of audits to twice a year, whereas Clause 1 provides more specific obligations regarding the approvals and tasks they can perform each time.

Therefore, I conclude that these clauses have different meanings because one allows for conditions on approval and certain tasks being conducted without prior approvals, while the other emphasizes the right to audit under specific terms.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that the Reseller acknowledges a designated representative of NovaCharge can examine, audit, reproduce, and take copies of their records under Section 16. It also mentions that the approval shouldn't be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The audits will happen during regular business hours at reasonable intervals no more than twice per year.

Clause 2 is almost the same but with a twist. It states that the representative isn't authorized to examine, audit, etc., the records. Wait, so in Clause 1 it's allowed and in Clause 2 it's not? That seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again. In Clause 1, it says the representative is authorized. In Clause 2, does it say they're not authorized? Or does it change something else?

Looking closely: Clause 1 allows the representative to do these things, and specifies that the approval process shouldn't be unreasonable. Clause 2 starts with ""is not authorized"" which directly contradicts Clause 1. So in one clause, NovaCharge's rep is allowed, and in the other, they're explicitly not allowed.

That would make them different because one grants permission while the other denies it. Also, looking at the frequency: Clause 1 limits audits to no more than twice a year, while Clause 2 says ""no less than"" twice a year. Hmm, that's interesting. So in Clause 1, they can be done up to twice a year, but in Clause 2, they have to be done at least twice a year. That adds another layer of difference.

Wait, but the main point is the authorization part. If one says ""is authorized"" and the other says ""is not authorized,"" that's a clear contradiction. So regardless of the frequency part, their central meaning about who can do what is different.

I think I'm confident now that they are different because one allows the representative to perform certain actions and the other prohibits them.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read Clause 1 carefully. It says that the Reseller acknowledges a designated representative of NovaCharge approved by them is authorized to examine, audit, reproduce, and take copies of records under Section 16. The approvals shouldn't be unreasonably withheld. Exams and audits happen during business hours, at reasonable intervals, no more than twice a year.

Now, Clause 2 starts with ""Reseller Affirmation of Audit Rights."" It states that the Reseller agrees a representative selected by NovaCharge and approved by them (again, without unreasonable withholding) can inspect, audit, duplicate, and retain copies of records required under Section 16. The audits must be during standard business hours, at reasonable intervals, not exceeding two occurrences in any calendar year.

Comparing both clauses, the main points are:

1. **Scope**: Both give auditing rights to a representative from NovaCharge approved by the Reseller.
2. **Approval Process**: In both cases, approval can't be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.
3. **Frequency and Timing**: Audits happen during business hours, at reasonable intervals, not more than twice a year.

The language in both clauses seems very similar. They use identical phrases like ""designated representative,"" ""approved by Reseller,"" ""examine, audit, reproduce, and take copies,"" and the timing constraints are the same. The only difference I notice is the phrasing of the approval part: Clause 1 uses ""approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,"" while Clause 2 says ""with approval not being subject to unreasonable withholding, conditioning, or delay."" Essentially, it's the same meaning but slightly differently worded.

So, both clauses are granting the same auditing rights under similar conditions. There doesn't seem to be any conflicting information between them. Therefore, I think they have the same meaning.

Alright, I'm looking at these two clauses to see if they mean the same thing or not. 

Clause 1 says that NovaCharge's representative is authorized to examine and audit Reseller's records up to twice a year. It also mentions this approval can't be unreasonably withheld.

Clause 2 starts similarly but then states that the representative is NOT authorized to do those things, which directly contradicts Clause 1. Also, it changes ""no more than twice"" to ""no less than twice,"" meaning they have different frequency requirements.

So, the key differences are in authorization and the audit frequency. Therefore, these clauses are definitely different.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 says that a designated representative from NovaCharge, approved by Reseller (with approval not unreasonably withheld), can examine, audit, reproduce, and take copies of records under Section 16. It mentions this happens during regular business hours at reasonable intervals, no more than twice a year.

Clause 2 is titled ""Reseller Affirmation of Audit Rights."" It states the Reseller agrees that a representative chosen by NovaCharge and approved by them (approval not unreasonably withheld) can inspect, audit, duplicate, and retain copies. Inspections and audits are during standard business hours, at reasonable intervals, not exceeding two times per calendar year.

Comparing term by term: both allow representatives from NovaCharge to access records with Reseller's approval, which can't be unreasonably denied. The actions allowed include examining, auditing, reproducing/copying, and in Clause 2, retaining copies. The timing is the same—regular business hours, reasonable intervals, up to twice a year.

The main difference I notice is wording: ""designated representative"" vs ""representative selected by NovaCharge,"" but essentially both mean NovaCharge picks someone Reseller approves. Also, ""examine, audit, reproduce and take copies"" versus ""inspect, audit, duplicate, and retain copies""—these seem to cover the same actions just phrased differently.

So overall, they both convey the same rights and conditions for audits by NovaCharge on Reseller's records.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses about inspections are the same or different. Let me read them again.

Clause 1 says: ""The Licensee shall permit the Licensor to visit and inspect the properties of the Company..."" That seems like it gives the company more permissions than the clause with a dash, which is probably ""not permitted.""

Clause 2 has a dash after ""allow,"" making it even stricter. It uses the word ""shall not permit"" in both sentences. The main difference is that the first one just says ""permits,"" while the second explicitly states ""shall not permit."" 

I think the wording matters because using ""shall not permit"" might make the language more formal and clear about the restrictions. Plus, the dash before ""allow"" could be used for emphasis or to draw attention.

So putting it together, these clauses are different in wording and intention.

Clause 2 is ""Review Rights,"" which states the Licensor has access to company premises for reviewing documents and discussing operations. Again, it mentions reasonable times and advance notice.

Both clauses use similar phrases like ""visit properties"" and ""make copies thereof."" They both talk about accessing records and discussing matters with officers. The main difference seems to be the word used: Inspection vs. Review Rights. So I think they're different terms for the same concept.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's take a closer look.

Clause 1 says that the Licensee ""shall permit"" the Licensor to do several things: visit properties, inspect corporate and financial records, make copies, and discuss affairs with officers. It also mentions this can be done at reasonable times with reasonable notice as requested by the Licensor.

Clause 2 is almost identical but starts with ""shall not permit."" That's a big difference because one allows the Licensor to do these things while the other prohibits them.

So, in Clause 1, the Licensee must allow inspections and related activities. In Clause 2, they can't allow it at all. This directly contradicts each other, meaning their meanings are opposite.

Clause 1 starts with ""Inspection"" and says that the Licensee should allow the Licensor to visit and inspect the company's properties, examine corporate and financial records, make copies, and discuss affairs, finances, and accounts with officers. It mentions doing this at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice as requested by the Licensor.

Clause 2 is titled ""Review Rights"" and states that the Licensor can access and inspect the company's premises. This includes reviewing and copying corporate and financial documents and discussing operations, financial matters, and accounts with officials. These activities should happen at reasonable times with reasonable advance notice, as requested by the Licensor.

Breaking it down, both clauses give the Licensor the right to inspect or review the company's properties, records, and discuss various aspects with officers or officials. They also specify that this can be done at reasonable times with notice given by the Licensor.

The main difference I notice is in the titles: Clause 1 uses ""Inspection"" while Clause 2 uses ""Review Rights."" However, the content seems similar because both are about allowing the Licensor to examine and discuss company matters. The methods of access and the conditions (reasonable times and notice) are also identical in both clauses.

I don't see any significant differences beyond the title, which doesn't change the meaning. So I think they have the same meaning.

Now, Clause 2 starts similarly: ""The Licensee shall not permit the Licensor..."" Oh wait, that's a big difference. The first clause is about permitting something, and this one is saying they shall NOT permit it. So instead of allowing access, they're forbidding it.

I need to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Both clauses mention visiting, inspecting properties, examining records, making copies, discussing affairs—same details but with opposite obligations. The first requires cooperation, the second prohibits it.

So clearly, one is saying ""must allow"" and the other is ""must not allow."" Therefore, they have completely different meanings.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""During the Term and for twelve (12) months thereafter, each of the parties shall provide the other party [...] exhibit-related books and records [...] to inspect and copy, and to perform [...] audits or reviews [...]"" 

Clue 2 is almost the same but without the word ""shall."" So it says, ""need not provide [...] exhibits-related books and records [...] to inspect and copy, and to perform [...] audits or reviews...""

Hmm. The main differences I can see are in the tense of ""provide"" versus ""need not provide."" In English, we use ""shall"" for past participles like ""shall provide"" when it's a rule that must be followed. But ""need not"" is often used with verbs like ""must,"" which also has its own set of rules.

I remember that ""need not"" can sometimes mean that the obligation is removed, but in this context, both clauses are about obligations (the parties being required to do something). So does using ""shall"" or ""need not"" change what's being said?

I think in these cases where the action is an obligation, the difference between ""shall"" and ""need not"" might be minor. They can often mean similar things, especially when it's a legal clause that must be followed.

Also, considering the structure, both clauses are making a promise about providing something at certain times and conditions. The main change is the choice of word—""shall"" vs. ""need not."" Since these clauses are likely to enforce similar rules, the difference might be insignificant in terms of meaning.

I don't see any other differences like exceptions or specific phrases that would make them different. Both specify the parties needing access to books and records for audits or reviews, which is the same in both clauses.

So putting it all together, I think they have the same meaning even though the verbs are slightly different.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both clauses carefully and break them down.

Clause 1 starts with ""During the Term and for twelve months thereafter."" That means it's a period over ten years, which is longer than what I think about when people talk about term durations. Then it says each party will provide access to the other during regular business hours at such place. The key here seems to be that this access happens both during the term and after its termination.

Clause 2 mentions ""throughout the duration of the agreement"" followed by a period of one year following its termination. So the term for the second clause is only one year, making it shorter than the first. Both clauses mention providing access to the other party's books and records, but I need to look at the specifics.

In Clause 1, the access requires ""full and complete access"" during regular business hours, with the party performing audits or reviews. The key here is that each party gives access on their own terms, perhaps requiring reasonable notice. The purpose seems more aligned with the other party's business operations but doesn't specify a period beyond the term.

Clause 2 states it's throughout the duration of the agreement and one year following termination. It also says comprehensive access provided by the other party during standard business hours to review or audit. Here, it's clear that both parties agree to this access, and it happens in two different time frames: ten years for the first clause and a year after termination.

The main differences are the duration of the agreement (10 years vs. 1 year), the specifics of what constitutes ""full access"" (each party provides their own terms) versus a comprehensive amount (both parties agree). Additionally, Clause 2 mentions ""comprehensive access,"" which isn't present in Clause 1.

So I think they are different because they have different durations and different requirements about how access is provided.

Clause 1 says that during the Term and for twelve months after, each party must provide the other with access to their Exhibit-related books and records upon reasonable notice, during regular business hours at the normal place of business. The purpose is so the other party can inspect, copy, and perform audits or reviews at their own discretion and expense.

Clause 2 is similar in structure but uses ""need not"" instead of ""shall provide."" So it says each party doesn't have to provide access unless required by law or if they agree to do so. The rest seems the same: access upon reasonable notice, during regular hours at their normal place of business for inspecting, copying, and performing audits or reviews.

Hmm, the key difference is in Clause 2's ""need not"" versus Clause 1's ""shall provide."" In law, ""shall"" usually means a mandatory obligation. So Clause 1 is an obligation, whereas Clause 2 is more of an optional obligation, only required if the party chooses to do so or is compelled by law.

So in Clause 1, they must give access. In Clause 2, they don't have to unless they want to or are legally bound. That's a significant difference in their obligations. So the meaning isn't the same because one is mandatory and the other is optional.

The purpose is for inspection, copying, and performing audits or reviews by the other party at their discretion and expense.

Clause 2: This one says that throughout the agreement's duration and for a year after termination, both parties agree to grant comprehensive access upon reasonable notice to each other's books and records related to the Exhibit. The access happens during standard business hours at the usual location. It mentions inspection and duplication of records and allows the other party to conduct audits or reviews at their discretion and cost.

Comparing these two, the main points are the same. Both mention a period of one year after termination (Clause 1 says ""during the Term"" which I assume is the active period, so the twelve months after would cover the Term plus a year). They both allow access upon reasonable notice, during business hours at the normal place. The purpose includes inspection, copying, and audits or reviews by the other party, with the cost being on the requesting party.

I don't see any significant differences in what they're saying. Both clauses are about providing access for similar reasons, with the same duration and conditions. So I think they mean the same.

This includes inspecting, copying, auditing, or reviewing their Exhibit-related books and records at their place of business during regular hours. The expenses are borne by the requesting party.

Now looking at Clause 2, it uses similar wording but starts with ""each of the parties need not provide..."" which changes the obligation from a requirement to an option. So instead of being mandatory, providing access is optional here. That's a significant difference because one clause enforces access while the other allows each party to decide whether to grant it.

So, the key difference is that Clause 1 imposes an obligation, whereas Clause 2 does not require either party to provide access. This means they have different meanings because one is mandatory and the other is optional.

Clause 1 says: ""AUDITING 6.17 The Manager shall at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner and such times as may be mutually agreed.""

I think this one seems pretty clear. It's explicitly telling the manager to keep their records accurate from the start, which is a good practice because it builds trust with the owner.

Clause 2 says: ""AUDITING 6.17 The Manager need not at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall not make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner and such times as may be mutually agreed.""

Hmm, this one uses ""need not"" which means it's a bit more relaxed. It doesn't require maintaining accurate records every time. So while it still has to do something about making the account available for inspection and auditing, it's less strict than Clause 1.

So comparing both clauses, they both emphasize that the manager should be honest by keeping their accounts correct. The main difference is that one requires them to maintain all of the time agreed upon, while the other just doesn't require it at all. So if ""need not"" means ""not necessarily,"" then the wording makes Clause 2 less strict in requiring the account maintenance.

Therefore, they have different meanings because one enforces a stricter requirement and the other is less so.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. I need to determine whether two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different.

First, I'll look at each clause individually. 

Clause 1: It says ""AUDITING 6.17 The Manager shall at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner and such times as may be mutually agreed."" So it mentions an audit, the manager must maintain accurate accounts, which are accessible for audits, and this happens at specific times.

Clause 2: ""Audit Rights 6.17 The Manager is obligated to consistently uphold and preserve accurate and truthful accounting records. These records must be made accessible for review and examination by the Owner at times that are agreed upon by both parties."" This one emphasizes auditing rights and consistency in recording, making records available for review with specific times.

Comparing both clauses, I notice that the first mentions an audit process (auditing) while the second focuses on the right to do audits. However, they both talk about maintaining accurate accounts, their availability, and the necessity of such reviews or audits at specific times. 

Wait, but in Clause 2, it says ""recorded records must be made accessible for review,"" which is a bit different from ""available for inspection and auditing."" But in terms of content, both are addressing accuracy, availability, and review times.

So, I think they're meant to convey similar concepts but through slightly different phrasing. Therefore, the answer should be ""Same.""

The two clauses share commonalities but differ in wording, so their meanings might overlap but not necessarily be identical. However, given the context provided, both seem to address maintaining accurate accounting records and providing access for review at specific times.

Clause 1 says that the Manager ""shall at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner and such times as may be mutually agreed."" So, it's a requirement on the Manager to keep accurate records and make them accessible whenever the Owner or mutually agreed upon times.

Clause 2 states that the Manager ""need not at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall not make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner and such times as may be mutually agreed."" Here, it's saying the opposite: the Manager doesn't have to maintain accurate records and shouldn't provide access.

So, Clause 1 imposes an obligation on the Manager, while Clause 2 removes that obligation. They are diametrically opposed in their wording and meaning. Therefore, they must be different.
</think>

Different","

Different","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me start by reading them carefully.

Clause 1 talks about ""AUDITING 6.17"" and says that the Manager must maintain true accounts and make them available for inspection and auditing by the Owner at mutually agreed times. It's pretty straightforward—it’s about the Manager’s responsibility to keep accurate records and allow the Owner to audit them whenever they agree.

Clause 2 is titled ""Audit Rights 6.17."" It states that the Manager is obligated to uphold accurate accounting records and must make these accessible for review by the Owner at agreed times. This seems similar to Clause 1. Both talk about the Manager maintaining records, making them available, and allowing the Owner to audit or inspect them at mutually agreed times.

I'm noticing that both clauses mention the same section number (6.17), discuss the Manager’s duty regarding accounting records, and involve the Owner's right to inspect or audit these records. The language used is quite similar: ""make the same available for inspection and auditing"" in Clause 1 versus ""make accessible for review and examination"" in Clause 2.

However, I should check if there are any differences in wording that could imply a different meaning. In Clause 1, it's phrased as ""the same,"" which might be a bit vague, while Clause 2 uses more specific verbs like ""uphold,"" ""preserve,"" ""accurate and truthful accounting records,"" and ""review and examination."" But the core requirement is the same: the Manager must keep accurate records and allow the Owner to inspect them at agreed times.

So, despite slight differences in wording, the meaning seems consistent. Both are about the Manager’s obligation to maintain and make available financial records for the Owner's audit or inspection.

Clause 1 says: ""The Manager shall at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner at such times as may be mutually agreed."" So, this means the manager must always have accurate records and let the owner check them whenever they both agree on a time.

Clause 2 states: ""The Manager need not at all times maintain and keep true and correct accounts and shall not make the same available for inspection and auditing by the Owner and such times as may be mutually agreed."" Here, it's saying the manager doesn't have to keep accurate records all the time and shouldn't allow the owner to inspect or audit them.

So, comparing both, Clause 1 is an obligation for the manager to maintain accurate accounts and make them accessible upon mutual agreement. Clause 2 removes that obligation, stating the manager isn't required to do so. The verbs ""shall"" vs. ""need not"" are key here—Clause 1 uses a strong requirement, while Clause 2 negates it entirely.

Therefore, these clauses have opposite meanings. One enforces accountability and transparency, while the other restricts both.

Clause 2 says: ""Audit Rights 6.17 The Manager is obligated to consistently uphold and preserve accurate and truthful accounting records. These records must be made accessible for review and examination by the Owner at times that are agreed upon by both parties.""

This one talks about audit rights. It mentions the manager's obligation to maintain accurate records, which the owner can review or examine when they agree.

Comparing them, both clauses seem similar in structure and content. Both require the manager to keep accurate accounts/records. Both allow the owner to inspect or audit these records at mutually agreed times. The wording is slightly different—like ""maintain and keep"" vs. ""obligated to consistently uphold""—but the meaning seems the same. 

I don't see any differences in what they're requiring or allowing. So I think they have the same meaning.

Clause 1 and Clause 2 both start with the same addition: ""In addition, upon ten day's written notice and no more often than once annually, GMI may, at its expense, audit GE's use of the Software and Documentation."" So that part is identical. That suggests they might be structurally similar.

Next, it says "" Any such audit shall be conducted during regular business hours..."" For Clause 1, it mentions conducting during regular business hours. In Clause 2, it states, ""any such audit need not be conducted during regular business hours."" So here's a difference in verb tense and structure: one uses ""shall be conducted"" while the other says ""need not be conducted.""

In clause 3 of both, it says ""if an audit reveals that GE has underpaid or overpaid fees to GMI..."" This part is exactly the same for both clauses.

Then, Clause 1 adds: ""then GE shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees or receive a credit or refund in GMI's sole discretion for such overpaid fees which such fees shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement."" Clause 2 also says the same thing here. So that part is identical too.

The only difference seems to be where ""any such audit"" was mentioned: one specifies conducting during regular business hours, and the other doesn't. But both clauses are structurally the same beyond that point. The key difference is in clause 3's phrasing of the duration of the audit execution (conducting during business hours) vs. not making that commitment.

So considering these changes, it seems like the overall meaning remains the same, just slightly adjusted. Therefore, they should be considered ""Same.""

Then it mentions GMI may audit GE using Software and Documentation, which must be done during regular business hours without causing undue disruption. If there are over or underpayments, GE is charged for the shortfall in GMI's discretion.

Clause 2 says ""With ten (10) days' advance notice."" Wait, that seems a bit different from Clause 1. It uses ""advise"" instead of ""notice."" Then it mentions limited to a single occurrence each year at GMI's cost. They can inspect GE's usage but must happen during normal business hours without disrupting operations. If there are discrepancies, GE is billed for the underpayment or overpayment in GMI's discretion.

Comparing both clauses, they both require ten days of notice before the inspection. The key difference seems to be the frequency—Clause 1 uses ""no more often than once annually,"" while Clause 2 just says ""advise."" This could imply that one is annual and the other is for a single occurrence each year. Also, both clauses mention the amount GE must be invoiced or refunded in GMI's discretion.

I'm leaning towards them being similar because they both specify the notice period (ten days), the frequency limits, the time of inspection, and how any discrepancies are handled. The main difference is the terminology used: ""advise"" vs. ""no more often than once annually."" But since they're both part of a contract, slight changes in wording shouldn't make them different.

If the audit finds that GE underpaid or overpaid fees, GE will be invoiced for the underpayment or get a refund or credit from GMI based on their sole discretion.

Clause 2 has similar wording initially: same notice period, same frequency (once annually), and same party paying for the audit. But here's where I notice differences. Clause 2 says that the audit doesn't need to be conducted during regular business hours and may unreasonably interfere with GE's activities. That's a key difference because Clause 1 explicitly prohibits unreasonable interference.

Also, in Clause 2, when an audit reveals underpayment or overpayment, it states ""GE shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees or receive a credit or refund..."" whereas Clause 1 says ""GE shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees or receive a credit or refund... which such fees shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement."" The wording is slightly different in the consequences. 

Wait, in both clauses, if GE underpaid, they get invoiced, and if overpaid, they can get a refund or credit. So the outcomes are similar but phrased differently.

Another difference is about the interference. Clause 1 says the audit shouldn't unreasonably interfere, while Clause 2 allows for it to possibly interfere unreasonably. That's a significant difference because it affects how the audit is conducted and whether it disrupts GE's operations.

So overall, both clauses allow GMI to audit GE once a year after 10 days' notice, at GE's facilities during business hours (in Clause 1) or not necessarily (Clause 2), and with consequences based on fee payment issues. The main differences are about the timing of the audit (business hours vs. without restriction) and whether interference is allowed.

Therefore, I think they are different because of these specific variations.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by mentioning a 10-day written notice from GMI to audit GE's software usage once a year. It says GMI will conduct the audit during regular business hours at GE's facilities without causing unreasonable interference. If GE underpaid, they get billed; if overpaid, GE might get a credit or refund based on GMI's discretion.

Clause 2 also talks about a 10-day advance written notice by GMI to inspect GE's software usage once a year. It specifies that the inspection is at GMI's cost and must happen during GE's normal business hours at their premises without causing undue disruption. If discrepancies are found, like underpayment or overpayment, GE will be billed for the shortfall or receive a refund or credit based on GMI's decision, calculated in line with the agreement.

Comparing both, they mention the same timeframe (10 days), same frequency (once annually), and similar consequences if GE hasn't paid correctly. The main differences are minor: Clause 1 says ""no more often than once annually,"" which is a bit redundant but still implies annual. Clause 2 specifies ""limited to a single occurrence each year"" which is slightly different wording but means the same thing.

The process for audits/inspections is almost identical—notice period, location during business hours, no disruption, and consequences based on payment discrepancies. The only differences are in phrasing but not in substance.

Okay, so I have two legal clauses here that I need to compare and determine if they mean the same thing or not. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 says: In addition, upon ten (10) day's written notice and no more often than once annually, GMI may, at its expense, audit GE's use of the Software and Documentation. Any such audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at GE's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with GE's business activities. If an audit reveals that GE has underpaid or overpaid fees to GMI, then GE shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees or receive a credit or refund in GMI's sole discretion for such overpaid fees which such fees shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement.

Clause 2 is almost the same but with some key differences. It also starts the same way about giving ten days' notice and only once a year, GMI can audit GE at their expense. But then it says: Any such audit need not be conducted during regular business hours at GE's facilities and may unreasonably interfere with GE's business activities.

So the main difference is in how the audits are conducted. Clause 1 requires that the audits happen during regular business hours at GE's place and mustn't cause unreasonable interference. On the other hand, Clause 2 allows for audits outside of regular hours and even says it may unreasonably interfere with GE's activities.

That seems like a significant difference because in one case, GMI has to be considerate of GE's schedule and business operations, while in the other, they don't have that restriction. The rest of the clauses about invoicing underpaid fees or giving credits/refunds are the same in both, but the conditions for conducting the audit differ.

Therefore, the two clauses aren't the same because they outline different terms regarding when and how audits can be performed.

Alright, let me try to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. I'll start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 says that GMI can audit GE's use of Software and Documentation after giving ten days' written notice. This can happen no more than once a year. The audit is at GMI's expense, conducted during regular business hours without unreasonable interference. If there are discrepancies in payments, GE will be invoiced for underpayment or get a credit/refund for overpayment, with GMI deciding how to handle it based on the Agreement.

Clause 2 states that GMI can inspect GE's utilization of Software and Documentation with ten days' advance notice, limited to once a year. The inspection is at GMI's cost, during normal business hours without undue disruption. If discrepancies are found regarding payments, GE will be billed for underpayment or get a credit/refund, again at GMI's discretion and in line with the Agreement.

Comparing both, they mention audits/inspections with ten days' notice once annually, conducted at GMI's expense during business hours without causing disruption. Both handle payment discrepancies similarly, giving GMI sole discretion over refunds or credits as per the Agreement.

The wording is slightly different—like ""audit"" vs. ""inspect,"" ""no more often than once annually"" vs. ""limited to a single occurrence each year""—but these seem synonymous in meaning. The structure and requirements are identical: notice period, frequency, who bears the cost, timing of inspection, handling of payment issues.

So, despite minor wording differences, both clauses convey the same rights and obligations for GMI and GE regarding audits/inspections, payment adjustments, and procedures.

Clause 1 says: Each party's disaster recovery plan will be made available for examination, review or audit by another party (or its duly authorized representative) within thirty days of submission of a written request, or such longer time as may be mutually agreed upon.

Clause 2: It seems identical to Clause 1. Both start with the same sentence and have the same conditions about the disaster recovery plans being available for examination within 30 days after a written request. Then they both mention that a longer period is allowed if mutual agreement is reached.

So, at first glance, these two clauses are exactly the same. They just repeat each other's points. I don't see any differences in the wording or the conditions. Both clauses state that the plans become available within 30 days after submission and allow for an extension under certain circumstances.

I should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing, like variations in language or different legal nuances. But both seem to be enforcing a time limit on availability and offering flexibility unless terms are met. 

Yes, they're the same because they're stating the same rule in parallel. There's no change in content or meaning here.

Hmm, I think both clauses mention the plans being accessible within thirty days after submission. They also specify that if they don't agree, it might be longer. The main difference is in the title of the clause. Wait, Clause 2 uses ""Title"" which isn't a standard legal term. Maybe it's just an emphasis on access.

Also, both clauses mention access to their plan for examination, review, or audit. So I think they're similar except that one starts with ""Title:"" which might be a typo or wording variation, and the rest is almost identical.

Clause 1 says that each party's disaster recovery plan must be available for examination, review, or audit by another party or their representative within thirty days of a written request, or as mutually agreed upon. So it's mandatory; they have to make it available either within thirty days or after agreeing on a longer time.

Clause 2 states that each party's disaster recovery plan need not be made available under the same conditions. The word ""need not"" here suggests that there's no obligation. So, unlike Clause 1, which requires availability, Clause 2 says they don't have to make it available at all within thirty days or as per a mutual agreement.

So, putting this together, Clause 1 imposes an obligation, whereas Clause 2 removes that obligation. Therefore, their meanings are different because one requires making the plan available and the other doesn't.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's take it step by step.

Clause 1 starts by saying that each party's disaster recovery plan must be made available for examination, review, or audit by another party or their representative within 30 days of a written request, unless a longer period is agreed upon mutually. It seems pretty straightforward—granting access within 30 days or as mutually decided.

Clause 2 has a title: ""Inspection of Disaster Recovery Plans."" The body says that upon receiving a written request, each party must provide access for examination, review, or audit by any other party or their authorized representative. This access must be granted within 30 days unless a longer period is agreed upon. 

Hmm, the key here is to check if both clauses are saying exactly the same thing. Clause 1 mentions ""examination, review, or audit,"" while Clause 2 also lists ""examination, review, or audit."" Both require that access must be granted within 30 days unless extended mutually. The only difference I notice is that Clause 2 adds a title, but the content seems identical.

I should make sure there aren't any subtle differences in wording. In Clause 1, it's phrased as ""made available for examination... or audit,"" and Clause 2 says ""provide access to their disaster recovery plan for examination... or audit."" The meaning is the same: the party must allow another party to inspect, review, or audit their DRP within a set timeframe unless extended.

So, yes, both clauses are essentially saying the same thing. They might have slightly different wording but convey identical obligations.

Clause 2 states: Each party's disaster recovery plan need not be made available under the same conditions—within thirty days or as agreed upon longer. 

So, the key difference is in the verbs used. Clause 1 uses ""will be made available,"" which sounds like an obligation or requirement. It means that each party must provide their plan upon request within the specified time.

Clause 2, on the other hand, says ""need not be made available."" The word ""need"" here suggests that it's optional. So, this clause is indicating that there's no requirement for the parties to make their plans available under those circumstances. It's more like they're not compelled to do so.

So, putting it together: Clause 1 is enforcing a duty to share the plan, while Clause 2 is saying there's no such duty. Therefore, they have opposite meanings. They can't be the same because one requires action and the other allows for omission.

Clause 1 says that each party's disaster recovery plan will be made available for examination, review, or audit by another party (or its authorized representative) within thirty days of a written request. It also mentions that if they mutually agree, a longer time is possible.

Clause 2 has the title ""Inspection of Disaster Recovery Plans."" It states that upon receiving a written request, each party must provide access to their plan for examination, review, or audit by another party or its authorized representative. The access needs to be granted within thirty days from the request date unless a longer period is mutually agreed.

Comparing both clauses: They both talk about making disaster recovery plans available upon a written request. Both mention that the time frame is 30 days, but it can be extended with mutual agreement. The actions allowed are examination, review, or audit, and they apply to each party's plan for another party or their representatives.

I don't see any differences in what they're requiring. They just phrase things slightly differently, like ""made available"" vs. ""provide access,"" but the meaning is the same. So I think these clauses have the same meaning.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: At Administrative Agent's request, make available for inspection... within a reasonable time after the written request. It mentions books and records of Lenders, any guarantees, Collateral, and financial information about the lender or guaranteeors within that time.

Clause 2 is similar but doesn't specify whether it includes the Collateral in the books and records. So it says ""any books and records"" without specifying they're of Lenders only or also including Collateral.

I think the main difference is what's included in the books and records for each clause. Clause 1 mentions both Lenders and Collateral, while Clause 2 doesn't mention them explicitly but still includes financial info about the lender.

Wait, so does that mean they're different? Because Clause 1 specifies the inclusion of Collateral, which Clause 2 doesn't. So even though the wording is similar except for ""any"" in Clause 1 and nothing in Clause 2, the implications might be slightly different because of what's included in the records.

I should check if ""books and records"" include the Collateral or not. If they don't specify that, maybe it's intended to include Lenders only as per the original text, but with both mentioned in Clause 1 for clarity. But since Clause 2 doesn't mention them explicitly, perhaps it's considered a broader application, allowing more resources to inspect.

So overall, I think they're different because Clause 1 includes Collateral while Clause 2 doesn't, so their meanings are slightly varied.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""At Administrative Agent's request."" Then it says, ""make available for inspection by duly authorized representatives of Lenders any of its books and records..."" Hmm, that seems a bit more formal at first glance because of the phrase ""any"" before ""books and records."" So maybe in Clause 2, it doesn't use ""any,"" but still uses the same structure.

Clause 1 says, ""any of its books and records, any of the books and records of any Guarantor..."" Again, using ""any"" here. It also mentions ""business affairs and financial condition or that of any Guarantor."" So the clause includes both the company's and each guarantee's information.

Clause 2 is: ""Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, permit duly authorized representatives of the Lenders to examine any of its books and records..."" This time it uses ""any"" again but doesn't mention guarantees. Then it says, ""as well as the books and records of any Guarantor."" Wait, that's different because now the clause explicitly includes the guarantees. It also provides access within a reasonable timeframe after a written request.

So comparing both clauses, both start with an Administrative Agent requesting something from the Lenders' representatives. Both mention inspecting various documents—company's own books and records, each guarantee's own books and records—and financial information about them or their guarantees. The main difference is in Clause 2: it explicitly mentions the guarantees when it refers to the company's books and records. In Clause 1, they use ""any"" instead of ""of any,"" which might be considered more formal or less specific.

Therefore, I think these clauses are somewhat similar but not exactly identical because one uses ""any"" before company documents and the other explicitly lists them under guarantees. That makes sense, so I'd say they're different.

Okay, so I need to determine whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""At Administrative Agent's request, make available..."" which means that it's an obligation on the part of the person or entity named here to provide access when requested. It specifies that this includes their own books and records, those of any Guarantor, the Collateral, and information about their business affairs and financial condition, all within a reasonable time after written request.

Clause 2 starts with ""At Administrative Agent's request, need not make available..."" This wording is interesting because ""need not"" usually implies an obligation to do something or not. So if someone says ""need not"" make available, does that mean they don't have to? That would suggest that in Clause 2, the person or entity isn't required to provide access, whereas in Clause 1, they are.

So, putting it together: Clause 1 is an obligation to comply with the request. Clause 2 says there's no need to comply, implying a lack of obligation. Therefore, they have different meanings because one requires action and the other doesn't.

It includes any of its own books, any Guarantor's books, the Collateral, and information about their business affairs and financial condition, within a reasonable time after a written request.

Clause 2 starts similarly with ""Upon the request of the Administrative Agent,"" and says to permit examination of its books and any Guarantor's books. It also mentions access to Collateral and information regarding business operations and financial status, again within a reasonable timeframe after a written request.

Hmm, both clauses seem to be granting Lenders' representatives access to various documents and information upon request from the Administrative Agent. The wording is quite similar, but I should check for any differences in structure or wording that might imply different meanings.

In Clause 1, it's about ""making available"" and ""inspection."" In Clause 2, it's about ""permitting"" examination. Does that make a difference? ""Make available"" and ""permit to examine"" – they both seem to convey the same action, just phrased differently.

Looking further, both clauses include books and records of the Administrative Agent and Guarantors, Collateral, and financial information. The timing is also the same: within a reasonable time after a written request. The only differences are in verbs used (""make available"" vs. ""permit to examine"") and slightly different phrasing of ""business affairs and financial condition"" versus ""business operations and financial status.""

These variations might be just stylistic, not indicating different legal meanings. So, I think both clauses are essentially the same in their intended effect.

Clause 2 starts similarly but uses ""need not make available."" That phrase ""need not"" is a big difference. It means that they don't have to comply with the request. 

So in Clause 1, it's an obligation—they have to provide access when asked. In Clause 2, it's optional; there's no requirement to do so. Therefore, the two clauses are expressing opposite obligations.

I should also check if there are any other differences beyond that key phrase. The rest of the clauses seem identical in terms of what is being referred to (books, records, collateral, etc.). So the only difference is whether it's mandatory or not. That makes them different.

Clause 2 mentions that upon the Administrative Agent's request, they must permit the Lenders' representatives to examine the same things—books, records, Collateral, and information on business operations and financial status—and this also needs to happen within a reasonable timeframe after a written request.

So both clauses require providing access to similar items: books, records, Collateral, and business/financial info. They both mention that it's upon the Administrative Agent's request and involves Lenders' representatives. The time frame is ""reasonable"" in both cases, following a written request.

The wording varies slightly—one uses ""make available for inspection,"" the other ""permit...to examine."" But the meaning seems identical—allowing access to these materials for review. Both include similar entities: the entity itself, any Guarantor, and cover all relevant information areas.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if these two clauses about the Buyer's obligation to disclose are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 mentions ""Books, records, and accounts required"" which includes details for the Sellers' Representative and the Seller’s Accountant. It also says that during their review, they can conduct audits or other checks at their own cost, allowing the Sellers’ Representative to determine if it's accepted.

Clause 2 is similar but a bit different. It states ""books, records, and accounts required"" without specifying the roles of the parties involved in the required documents. Then it says that the Sellers’ Representative isn't entitled to perform any audits or other checks at their costs, which they can use to assess acceptance.

Wait, so the key difference is whether the documents include the entities responsible for them. In Clause 1, both the Sellers’ Representative and the Seller’s Accountant are mentioned as needing access to these documents. But in Clause 2, it's not explicitly stated whose responsibility it is, which makes it less clear who should have those documents.

Also, Clause 1 mentions costs related to conducting audits or other verification procedures, whereas Clause 2 doesn't mention costs at all. That detail seems important for clarity. Without the cost information, the clause might be interpreted differently, especially if someone else can cover expenses.

So the main points of difference are:
1. The inclusion/exclusion of the roles (Sellers’ Representative vs. seller).
2. The mention of costs and procedures involving auditing.
3. The clear indication that the documents include specific entities, which wasn't specified in Clause 2.

I think these points make them different because one includes who needs to see certain documents, while the other doesn't specify that it's about the documents themselves but maybe just about having access. Also, the cost aspect is crucial for the explanation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let's break down each clause step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1: It mentions that the Buyer must make available books, records, and accounts required for verification during the Future Amounts Determination. Additionally, it says that as part of the Sellers’ Representative’s review, they can conduct audits or other verifications if needed, but these are done at their costs.

Then, Clause 2 talks about the Buyer needing access to those same books, records, and accounts. It also states that in reviewing this information, the preparers (Sellers’ Representative and Accountant) have a duty to provide necessary access for confirmation of the calculation and total. Importantly, they can perform audits or other verifications on their own cost, which is similar to what Clause 1 describes.

Comparing both clauses, they both require the Buyer to have access to specific documents (books, records, accounts). The main difference seems to be that Clause 1 specifically mentions verification during a process (the Determination) and says auditors are required at their costs. In contrast, Clause 2 simply states that the preparers must provide access for confirmation of the future amount determination but allows verifications on their own cost.

So, the key points where they differ are the nature of the verification done by auditors versus what is allowed in cases. Clause 1 requires specific auditors at costs, while Clause 2 only requires access to necessary info and allows self-verification.

Clause 1 starts by saying that the Buyer must make available certain books, records, and accounts to the Sellers' Representative and Accountant. This is to enable the Selling Shareholders to verify the amount and calculation of Future Amounts Determination. Then, it says that as part of the review, either the Representative or the Accountant can conduct any audit or verification procedure they think necessary at their own cost to determine whether they accept the Closing Statement.

Clause 2 is almost the opposite. It states that the Buyer need not make available those books and records. So the Buyer isn't required to provide them. Then, it says that the Sellers' Representative or Accountant are not entitled to conduct any audit or verification procedures. Therefore, they can't do anything at their own cost to verify the Closing Statement.

Wait, so in Clause 1, the Buyer must disclose information and the Seller's reps can audit, but in Clause 2, the Buyer doesn't have to disclose and the reps can't audit. So the obligations are directly opposite on two key points: whether the Buyer is required to provide books and records, and whether the Sellers' representatives can conduct audits.

Therefore, they don't have the same meaning. Clause 1 imposes an obligation on the Buyer and grants permission to the Sellers for verification, while Clause 2 removes that obligation from the Buyer and denies permission to the Sellers.

Clause 2 is titled Buyer's Duty to Provide Information. It states the Buyer must give access to necessary books, records, and accounts for the Selling Shareholders to confirm the calculation and total of Future Amounts Determination. Then, it says that during review, the Representatives or Accountants can perform audits at their own expense to decide on acceptance of the Closing Statement.

Comparing both clauses:

- Both require the Buyer to provide access to books, records, etc., so they have similar obligations there.
- Both allow Sellers’ Representative or Accountant to conduct audits and verification procedures necessary for their review.
- The cost is specified as ""at its costs"" in Clause 1 and ""at their own expense"" in Clause 2. This might be a difference if one party bears the cost differently than the other.

Wait, actually, in Clause 1 it's ""at its [their] costs,"" meaning perhaps the Sellers’ Representative or Accountant bear the cost, while in Clause 2 it's at their ""own expense."" Maybe that's slightly different wording but same meaning. The main point is who is paying for the audits.

But looking deeper, both clauses are about the Buyer providing information and allowing the Seller’s team to verify and audit. The only difference might be in how the cost is phrased—whether it's ""its"" or ""their own."" However, in legal terms, ""its"" could refer to the Sellers’ Representative or Accountant, so both clauses likely mean the same thing regarding who bears the cost.

Thus, despite minor wording differences, they seem to convey the same obligation. So I think they are the Same.

They also have the right to conduct audits or other procedures at their own cost.

In Clause 2, it's completely opposite. The Buyer ""need not make available,"" and the Sellers' Rep isn't entitled to do any audits or verification. So one is requiring disclosure and audit rights, the other is saying they don't need to disclose and can't conduct those procedures.

Also, they both mention the conditions: reasonable prior written notice and making repairs if necessary. And the purpose is for determining compliance with the lease or making repairs required.

Wait, but in Clause 2, it's saying they have no right to inspect. That seems contradictory because Clause 1 states ""right,"" which implies a positive clause about their ability to do something.

Clause 2 is: ""Review and Access Rights."" It states that the Lessor grants access rights to authorized agents, requiring reasonable written notice before delivering. The purpose is to review Lessee's adherence and conduct necessary repairs as per the lease.

Hmm, both clauses seem to be about getting either an inspection or accessing premises for checking compliance with a lease. They both require prior notice and can be used for repair purposes. So, they sound similar in function but might have minor differences in wording. Maybe one is more formal than the other? I should check if ""review"" in Clause 2 relates to something like ""inspect"" or ""review."" But in this context, both seem to be about checking compliance.

So, I think they're mostly the same but could differ in phrasing. But since they cover similar purposes and require similar actions (prior written notice), the answer should be ""Same.""

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that the Lessor has the right to inspect after giving reasonable prior written notice except in an emergency. It mentions this is for determining if the Lessee is complying with the lease terms or making repairs required under it.

Clause 2 states that the Lessor shall have no right to enter and inspect, even upon prior notice, except in emergencies. This seems contradictory because it's saying they have ""no right"" to do something that Clause 1 allows.

Wait, so in Clause 1, they can enter for inspection or repairs with prior notice unless there's an emergency. In Clause 2, the Lessor cannot enter at all for these purposes, even if they give notice, except maybe in emergencies. So one grants a right and the other denies it entirely.

Therefore, they must be different because one allows the action and the other prohibits it.

Okay, so I have to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 talks about Inspection. It says that the Lessor and their authorized reps can enter the premises after giving reasonable prior written notice, except in an emergency, for inspecting Lessee's compliance with the lease terms or making repairs needed hereunder.

Clause 2 is titled Review and Access Rights. It states that the Lessor, along with agents, has the right to access the premises or any part of it upon delivering reasonable written notice in advance, except emergencies. The purpose is verifying Lessee’s adherence to lease conditions or conducting necessary repairs as stipulated.

Hmm, both clauses allow the Lessor to enter for inspection and repairs. Both mention needing prior written notice, except in emergencies. They also state the purposes: compliance with terms or making repairs.

The wording is a bit different but seems to convey the same idea. Clause 1 says ""determining Lessee’s compliance"" while Clause 2 says ""verifying Lessee’s adherence."" The words ""compliance"" and ""adherence"" are synonyms, so that's consistent. Both specify that it's for lease terms or repairs.

So, both clauses grant similar rights to the Lessor: access upon notice (except emergencies) to check compliance or make repairs. They might have slightly different wording but essentially mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses about inspection are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that the Lessor and their representatives have the right to enter the premises after giving reasonable notice, except in emergencies. They can inspect for compliance with the lease terms or make repairs needed hereunder.

Clause 2 is almost identical but starts by saying they ""shall have no right."" So while Clause 1 grants them the right, Clause 2 explicitly takes that away. 

Wait, so one allows entry and inspection under certain conditions, and the other prohibits it except in emergencies? That's a big difference because having the right versus not having it changes everything about what they can do.

So even though the rest of the clauses are similar, the main point is whether the lessor has the right or not. Since one says yes and the other no, they must be different.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or are different. Let's break them down step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1: It says that the Lessor and their representatives can enter the Premises after giving reasonable written notice unless it's an emergency. The reasons for entering are to check compliance with the lease terms or make repairs required under the lease.

Now, Clause 2: This one mentions the Lessor and authorized agents have the right to access the Premises with reasonable written notice except in emergencies. The purposes are to verify Lessee’s adherence to the lease conditions or conduct necessary repairs as stipulated.

Comparing both clauses, they both allow the Lessor (and their representatives) to enter the Premises. They require reasonable prior notice except in emergencies. The purposes include checking compliance and making repairs. The wording is slightly different but conveys the same rights and obligations. 

So, the main points are consistent: right of entry, notice requirement, exceptions for emergencies, and reasons for access. Therefore, they seem to have the same meaning.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Both clauses start with ""Right to Inspect,"" which is a common term in property law. Let me break down each clause step by step.

Starting with Clause 1: It says that as long as Lessee has any obligations under the lease, Lessee can inspect the property. There are two parts here. The first part mentions ""reasonable notice from Lessor or Bank (except if a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing)."" So, in cases where a default exists, no notice is required. 

The second part says such inspections must not reasonably interfere with Lessee's business operations at the property. It uses ""reasonably interfere,"" which I think means that the inspection shouldn't cause any disruption or negative impact on Lessee's business.

Now looking at Clause 2: Same initial parts, but here they say ""so long as"" instead of ""as long as."" Hmm, in legal terms, ""as long as"" is often used to mean ""until,"" which could imply a period of time. But I'm not sure if ""so long as"" and ""as long as"" are considered the same or different. In some contexts, they might be interchangeable, but sometimes nuances make them different.

Then, Clause 2 adds that notice must be required when a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. That part is similar to what's in Clause 1 except for the use of ""except"" versus ""so long as."" Wait,Clause 1 uses ""unless,"" which might mean that if there's no default (i.e., the event hasn't happened yet), then notice isn't required. In contrast, Clause 2 explicitly requires notice when a default is ongoing.

So putting it all together: both clauses talk about Lessee having obligations under the lease and allowing inspection as long as certain conditions are met regarding notices and business operations. The key difference lies in how they handle the ""so long as"" clause—Clause 1 uses ""so long as,"" while Clause 2 explicitly states notice is required when a default occurs.

I think the main difference is in the phrasing of the ""so long as"" part, which affects whether it's an ""until"" or ""as long as"" period. The explicit mention of needing notice when a default is ongoing might make them slightly different in intent, even if they convey similar meanings.
</think>

Different","<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two clauses, ""Right to Inspect"" and ""Inspection Rights,"" are the same or different. Let me read through each clause carefully.

Starting with ""Right to Inspect."" The text says that as long as the Lessee has obligations to the Lessor under this Lease, the Lessee can inspect the property upon reasonable notice from either the Lessor or the Bank. Importantly, if a Lease Event of Default (LED) has occurred and is still continuing, no notice is required. Also, the inspections shouldn't reasonably interfere with the Lessee's business operations.

Then, ""Inspection Rights."" This one says that for as long as the Lessee has duties owed to the Lessor under this Lease, the Lessee must allow the Lessor or Bank (and their agents) to inspect the property after receiving reasonable notification from either party. If a LED is present and ongoing, notice is waived. The inspections should not unreasonably disrupt business activities.

Comparing both clauses, they seem very similar in structure. Both require the Lessee to inspect the property under certain conditions—on reasonable notice or without notice if LED has occurred—and ensure that such inspections don't cause disruptions during business operations.

Wait, but does ""inspector"" and ""inspectee"" matter? In legal terms, ""right to inspect"" often refers specifically to the right holder of the inspection authority. So maybe ""Right to Inspect"" is more about the Lessee's right, while ""Inspection Rights"" might refer to the Lessor or Bank. But in this context, it seems both clauses are enforcing the same rule: the Lessee must allow inspections as long as they have their duties, regardless of who holds the inspection authority.

Also, the notification requirements and discontinuement conditions are identical except for ""Lessor"" vs ""Bank."" But since ""bank"" is a financial institution, in legal contexts where ""Lessor"" might refer to an operator or landlord, it's probably acceptable. So both clauses are enforcing the same policy: Lessee can inspect as long as they have their duties, receive reasonable notice if needed, and inspections must not disrupt business.

So putting it together, they appear to be using slightly different legal terms (""right to inspect"" vs ""Inspection Rights"") but with identical purposes.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or are different. Both clauses start with ""Right to Inspect,"" which suggests they're about the same topic. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that as long as the Lessee has obligations to the Lessor under the lease, the Lessee must allow the Lessor or Bank and their representatives to inspect the property upon reasonable notice. However, if a Lease Event of Default has occurred, no notice is required, meaning they can inspect regardless.

Clause 2 is worded slightly differently. It states that as long as Lessee has obligations under the lease, Lessee ""shall not"" permit inspections unless a default occurs. So, in Clause 1, Lessee must allow inspections upon reasonable notice, while in Clause 2, it says Lessee shall not permit them unless there's a default.

Wait, so in Clause 1, Lessee is required to let the lessor inspect as long as they're still in obligations. In Clause 2, it's saying Lessee shouldn't allow inspections unless there's a default. That seems contradictory. So Clause 1 allows for inspections with notice when obligations exist, but Clause 2 prohibits inspections unless a default happens.

So one is about allowing inspections during the term, and the other is prohibiting them except in case of a default. Therefore, they're different in their wording and implications. So the answer would be ""Different.""

Clause 1 starts with ""Right to Inspect."" It says that as long as the Lessee has any obligations to the Lessor under the Lease, they must allow the Lessor or Bank to inspect upon reasonable notice, except if there's a Lease Event of Default happening right now. The inspections shouldn't interfere with the business operations.

Clause 2 is titled ""Inspection Rights."" It also says that as long as Lessee has duties to the Lessor under the Lease, they must allow inspection by Lessor or Bank upon receiving reasonable notification. But it adds that this notification requirement is waived if there's a Lease Event of Default occurring now. The inspections shouldn't disrupt business activities either.

Looking at the structure and wording, both clauses are about allowing inspections as long as obligations exist, with an exception for defaults. They both mention not interfering with business operations. So they seem to cover the same points but maybe use slightly different phrases.

Wait, in Clause 1 it's ""Lessee shall have any obligations"" while Clause 2 is ""Lessee has duties owed."" ""Duties owed"" might imply a stronger obligation, but in legal terms, both can refer to ongoing responsibilities. Also, both mention the same entities (Lessor, Bank) and the condition about not disrupting business.

The only difference I notice is in the wording: one uses ""obligations,"" the other ""duties owed."" But that's probably just semantic; legally, they mean the same. The structure of the sentences is also very similar, both starting with a conditional based on obligations/duties and mentioning the same elements.

So, I think they have the same meaning.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Right to Inspect. So long as Lessee shall have any obligations to Lessor under this Lease, Lessee shall, upon reasonable notice from Lessor or Bank (except that no notice shall be required if a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), permit Lessor or Bank and their respective authorized representatives to inspect the Property, provided that such inspections shall not reasonably interfere with Lessee's business operations at the Property.""

Clause 2 says: ""Right to Inspect. So long as Lessee shall have any obligations to Lessor under this Lease, Lessee shall not, upon reasonable notice from Lessor or Bank (except that notice shall be required if a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), permit Lessor or Bank and their respective authorized representatives to inspect the Property, provided that such inspections shall not reasonably interfere with Lessee's business operations at the Property.""

Hmm, the main difference I notice is in Clause 2 where it says ""Lessee shall not, upon reasonable notice..."" whereas Clause 1 just says ""Lessee shall..."". That seems contradictory. So, in Clause 1, the Lessee must permit inspections upon reasonable notice except when a default has occurred. In Clause 2, it's saying the Lessee shall not do that unless there's a default where notice is required.

Wait, no, actually looking closer: Clause 2 says ""Lessee shall not, upon reasonable notice..."" which could mean they are prohibited from requiring notice? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me break it down.

In Clause 1, the Lessee must permit inspections when given reasonable notice except in case of a default where no notice is needed. So Lessor or Bank can inspect with notice, but if there's a default, they don't need to give notice first.

In Clause 2, it says ""Lessee shall not, upon reasonable notice..."" so maybe the Lessee cannot refuse an inspection when given reasonable notice? Or perhaps the wording is flipped. Alternatively, in Clause 2, the exception states that ""notice shall be required if a Lease Event of Default has occurred,"" which flips the requirement compared to Clause 1.

So in Clause 1: No notice needed during default; in Clause 2: Notice is required even during default? That would make them different because they specify opposite conditions regarding when notice is necessary.

First, both clauses talk about inspection rights for the Lessor and Bank regarding the property under a lease agreement. The main points seem similar, but I need to check each part carefully.

Clause 1 mentions that Lessee must permit inspections upon reasonable notice unless there's a Lease Event of Default. It specifies that representatives can inspect without interfering with business operations.

Clause 2 states that Lessee must allow inspections with reasonable notification, except during a default, and mentions agents as well. It also notes that inspections shouldn't disrupt business activities.

Looking at the wording, both clauses cover allowing inspections, the need for notice (waived in default), who can inspect (representatives/agents), and the condition about not disrupting business. The structure is slightly different but the content seems identical.

I don't see any differences in the obligations or conditions mentioned. Both are ensuring that inspections happen under similar terms without causing significant disruption. So, they should mean the same thing.

Clause 1 says that the Recipient can allow The Developer or its reps to periodically examine their books, ledgers, records during business hours for verifying reports under this Agreement. If the amounts due are underpaid, the Recipient will pay the cost and accrued interest at the highest allowable rate.

Clause 2 is similar but changes one part: instead of allowing examination, it says they won't permit it. So if the amounts are underpaid, now The Recipient won't pay the exam fee or accrued interest at the allowed rate.

Wait, does ""permit"" and ""not permit"" mean different things? I think in legal terms, these might be considered the same, but maybe there's a nuance. Let me break it down.

First sentence of both clauses: Both mention that The Recipient can or won't allow examination. So that part is similar. Second part: in Clause 1, if amounts are underpaid, they pay the exam fee and interest at the highest rate. In Clause 2, the opposite happens—The Recipient doesn't pay those expenses.

Are there any differences? Hmm. The word ""may"" vs ""will not."" No, because both say ""allow"" or ""not allow,"" so that's the same.

Also, both clauses mention paying accrued interest if amounts are underpaid. So that part is consistent as well.

I don't see any other differences in the structure or wording between the two clauses. Both are imposing a condition on the Recipient regarding examination and payment upon underpayment. The only difference seems to be phrasing: ""allow"" vs. ""not permit."" But I think in legal terms, both mean the same action is taken.

Therefore, they should have the same meaning.

Alright, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 talks about the Recipient allowing The Developer's representatives to periodically examine their books, ledgers, and records for verification of reports under the Agreement. If there's an overpayment due, they have to pay the exam expenses and accrued interest at the highest allowed rate.

Clause 2 says the Recipient consents to The Developer's agents inspecting financial documents without any cost, only for verifying reports as per the Agreement. If payments are understated, the Recipient has to pay for the inspection plus interest at the maximum permissible rate.

Okay, so both clauses mention that the Receiving Party (Recipient) is allowing The Developer or its representatives/agents to inspect their financial documents. In Clause 1, it's specifically about paying exam costs and interest. In Clause 2, it's about no cost but includes an additional requirement for understated payments.

Wait, in Clause 2, the fee isn't explicitly mentioned; it's implied that there's a cost involved because they mention allowing at no cost to The Developer. So maybe it's just that they can pay without charge, while in Clause 1 they have to pay expenses and interest.

Also, both clauses require paying interest on overpayments or understated amounts but different rates? Wait, let me check again. In both cases, the interest rate is at the highest allowable rate. So no difference there.

But wait, the fee for Clause 2 might be considered a separate issue because in clause 1, it's about payment of expenses and interest, while clause 2 is about paying the fee without charge? Or maybe not necessarily separate issues—just different requirements on what they can pay.

Wait, looking back: In clause 1, ""exam expenses and accrued interest at the highest allowable rate."" So they have to pay these costs. In clause 2, it's just that they can pay without any cost, but for understated payments, they still have to bear expenses plus interest. Hmm, so maybe there's an implied expense in clause 2 because the fee isn't specified as a charge.

But I'm not sure if ""at no cost"" is considered separate from paying anything else or just about permission. Maybe it's similar in that both require payment for inspecting financial documents under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps one is a permission to pay (Clause 2) and the other is liability for expenses on overpayment (Clause 1). That could make them different because they're not the same type of obligation—permise versus liability.

So putting it together: Both clauses involve The Developer's agents inspecting financial documents. Clause 1 imposes costs, while Clause 2 doesn't specify a cost but allows for payment without charge and covers understated payments with expenses and interest.

Therefore, they are different because one requires paying certain fees or expenses, whereas the other is permissible without any fee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read through both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""The Recipient agrees to permit..."" So the Recipient is giving permission for The Developer or its representatives to examine their books and records. This examination is at The Developer's expense, during regular business hours, to verify reports under the agreement. If there's an underpayment, the Recipient has to pay for the exam and any accrued interest at the highest rate.

Clause 2 says ""The Recipient will not permit..."" So here, the Recipient is refusing permission for The Developer or its reps to examine their books. Again, it's at The Developer's expense during regular hours, same purpose of verifying reports. But if underpayment is found, the Recipient won't pay the cost or interest.

Looking at the structure: Clause 1 is about allowing and agreeing to the examination, while Clause 2 is refusing that permission. So in Clause 1, the Recipient must allow the exam, but in Clause 2, they explicitly say they won't permit it. The consequences are also opposite: Clause 1 says the Recipient pays if underpaid; Clause 2 says they won't pay.

So the main points are about whether permission is granted and whether the Recipient is liable for costs or not. Since these elements are opposites, the clauses don't have the same meaning. They're structured to do the opposite: one allows, the other prohibits.

If there's underpayment, the Recipient has to pay for the examination plus interest at the highest allowable rate.

Clause 2 says the Recipient consents to allowing The Developer or agents to inspect financial documents at no cost to the developer during standard business hours. It mentions this is solely for verifying reports mandated by the agreement and only as much as needed. If there's understated payments, the Recipient bears the expenses of inspection and pays interest on underpaid amounts at the maximum permissible rate.

Hmm, both clauses talk about the Recipient allowing The Developer to inspect their records, during business hours, for verifying reports. Both mention that if there's underpayment or understatement, the Recipient has to pay for the inspection and interest.

But wait, in Clause 1, the developer is at their expense, meaning they might cover it. In Clause 2, it says ""at no cost to The Developer,"" which implies the Recipient pays. Also, the rates mentioned are ""highest allowable rate"" vs. ""maximum permissible rate."" Those might be similar but could have slight differences in legal terms.

So, the main points: permission granted by Recipient, during business hours, for verifying reports, and if there's underpayment/understatement, Recipient pays for costs and interest.

In both clauses, the structure is similar—Recipient consents to inspection for verification purposes. The consequences are also the same: Recipient bears the cost of inspection and pays interest on any shortfall.

However, in Clause 1, it says "" Developer’s expense,"" implying the Developer might pay initially but could be reimbursed if there's a shortfall. In Clause 2, it's explicitly stated that the developer isn't at any cost, so the Recipient covers everything upfront.

Additionally, the interest rates have slightly different wording, which could matter legally, though they essentially mean the same high rate.

Overall, despite some minor differences in wording regarding who bears the initial cost and the exact phrasing of the interest rate, the clauses seem to convey the same overall obligations. The Recipient is allowing inspection, and if there's a shortfall, they are responsible for both the inspection costs and the interest on the underpaid amounts.

So, I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses mean the same thing or if they're different. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1: It says the Recipient agrees to let The Developer or their reps come in and examine their books, ledgers, etc., during regular hours. This is all at the Developer’s expense. The reason for this examination is to verify reports required under the agreement. If it turns out that the amounts owed to the Developer were underpaid, then the Recipient has to pay the cost of the exam plus accrued interest at the highest rate allowed.

Now, Clause 2 starts similarly but with a key difference: ""The Recipient will not permit..."" So instead of agreeing to let them examine, they are refusing. Also, it says that if there's underpayment, the Recipient won't pay for the examination costs or the interest.

So, the main differences I see are in permission and payment obligations. Clause 1 allows the Developer to inspect and requires the Recipient to cover costs if underpaid. Clause 2 forbids inspection and refuses to pay any related costs.

Therefore, these clauses have opposite meanings regarding both the permission for examination and the financial responsibilities.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two clauses are the same or different. Let's break them down step by step.

Clause 1 says that the Recipient agrees to let The Developer or its representatives examine their books, ledgers, and records during regular business hours. This is to verify any reports needed under the agreement. If they find that amounts due were underpaid, the Recipient pays for the exam and accrued interest at the highest rate.

Clause 2 mentions the Recipient consenting to allow The Developer or its designated agents to inspect financial documents, which include books, ledgers, etc., during standard business hours. This is solely to verify reports as per the agreement, only to the extent needed. If payments owed are understated, the Recipient covers inspection costs and pays interest at the maximum rate.

Comparing both clauses:

- Both talk about allowing access to financial records (books, ledgers, etc.) for verification of reports.
- The scope seems similar: during business hours, necessary for verifying reports under the agreement.
- If there's an underpayment, Recipient covers costs and pays interest at the highest rate.

Looking at wording differences:

- Clause 1 uses ""periodically examine"" while Clause 2 says ""inspect.""
- Costs are mentioned as ""at The Developer’s expense"" in Clause 1 and ""at no cost to The Developer"" in Clause 2. That's the same thing.
- Clause 2 specifies ""financial documents,"" which includes books, ledgers, etc., so it's comprehensive like Clause 1.

I don't see any significant differences in meaning. Both outline the right of inspection for verification purposes and financial consequences if underpayment is found. The wording variations don't change the substance.

Alright, I need to determine whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by carefully reading both clauses.

Clause 1 has ""as well as"" twice before ""the calculations."" It uses ""at Tenant's expense"" and then an alternative clause with ""Landlord may..."" using ""at its sole discretion."" The key here is that in Clause 1, there are two ""as well as"" clauses. One uses ""as an audited statement,"" the other refers to a prepared statement by an independent CPA.

Clause 2 doesn't repeat ""as well as""; it starts with ""Tenant shall have no right..."" and then states both clauses. The only difference is that Clause 1 has two instances of ""as well as"" using different verbs, while Clause 2 uses the same structure but without repetition.

So, in terms of meaning, both clauses convey the same essential requirements about tenant's audit rights. However, Clause 1 explicitly states two separate actions (one with ""as an audited statement,"" the other with a CPA) and includes an alternative clause for landlord. Clause 2 avoids repeating the ""as well as"" part but still uses a similar structure.

Therefore, both clauses are essentially saying that tenants have no right to perform audits and calculations without landlord's consent. The difference is in how they present the alternatives: Clause 1 provides two different types of audited statements (one by CPA), while Clause 2 states it in one way.

Okay, I need to determine if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let's break them down.

Clause 1 says that the Tenant has a right to audit the Building Operating Costs of the preceding year for May 15th, either by paying expenses or an CPA audited statement. The alternative is provided by the Landlord at its discretion.

Clause 2 states that the Tenant can audit from their own cost on any given year's prior expenses, with calculations done by a CPA, and this must be by May 15. They also have the option to provide an audited statement to the Tenant by a CPA if the Landlord doesn't.

Both clauses mention that the Tenant has a right to audit by May 15 at Tenant's expense or with a CPA. The exceptions are providing an audited statement from the Landlord, which is done solely by them.

So, both clauses give the same option for auditorium placement but differ in how they structure it. One is ""by month"" and the other specifies ""by year."" They both require the Landlord to provide an audited statement after the Tenant's audit.

Clause 1 says that the Tenant has a right, at their own expense, to perform an audit of Building Operating Costs by May 15 each year and calculate their Proportionate Share. But there's an alternative: the Landlord can, at its sole discretion, provide an audited statement from an independent CPA instead.

Clause 2 is almost the opposite. It states that the Tenant has no right to perform such an audit or calculation. The only thing left is that the Landlord may not provide the audited statement at its sole discretion. So the Landlord isn't required to give the Tenant the audited statement.

Comparing the two, Clause 1 gives the Tenant a right to audit and also grants the Landlord the option to provide an alternative. Clause 2 denies the Tenant any right to audit but allows the Landlord to choose not to provide the CPA statement. So in Clause 1, the Tenant has a right, while in Clause 2, they don't. The only similarity is that both mention the Landlord's potential action regarding providing the statement.

Therefore, Clauses 1 and 2 are different because one grants the Tenant rights and the other denies them. So I think the answer should be ""Different"".

Clause 2 states that the Tenant is entitled to conduct an audit of the same Building Operating Costs by May 15, also at their own cost. The second part mentions that the Landlord can provide an audited statement to the Tenant via an independent CPA, again at the Landlord's sole discretion.

Looking for differences: Both clauses allow the Tenant to audit the costs by May 15 each year. They both specify that this is at the Tenant's expense. Additionally, both mention that the Landlord may choose to provide an audited statement from a CPA instead, with the Landlord having sole discretion in whether or not to do so.

I don't see any differences in the structure or wording between Clauses 1 and 2. They both grant the same rights to the Tenant regarding auditing and state the same conditions for the Landlord's alternative action. Therefore, they seem to have the same meaning.

Alright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether two legal clauses are the same or different in meaning. The user has asked me to respond only with ""Same,"" ""Different,"" or ""Unsure."" But first, I'll walk through my thought process step by step.

First, let's read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1:
""Tenant shall have the right, at Tenant' expense, to perform by May 15 of any year an audit of the Building Operating Costs of the preceding calendar year as well as the calculations of Tenant's Proportionate Share thereof. Alternatively, Landlord may at its sole discretion provide Tenant with an audited statement of such expenses prepared by an independent Certified Public Accountant.""

Clause 2:
""Tenant is entitled, at their own cost, to conduct an audit of the Building Operating Costs from the prior calendar year, including the calculation of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of those costs, by May 15 of any given year. Alternatively, at the sole discretion of the Landlord, an audited statement detailing these expenses may be provided to the Tenant by an independent Certified Public Accountant.""

Okay, so both clauses are about the tenant's right to audit Building Operating Costs and their Proportionate Share. Let me break down each part.

In Clause 1, it says ""Tenant shall have the right"" which is similar to Clause 2's ""Tenant is entitled."" Both indicate that the tenant has a right or entitlement to perform an audit.

The cost aspect: Clause 1 mentions ""at Tenant' expense,"" and Clause 2 says ""at their own cost."" These seem equivalent, just phrased differently. So, both clauses state that the tenant bears the cost of the audit.

Timing: Both mention conducting this by May 15 of any year (Clause 1) or any given year (Clause 2). The wording is slightly different but conveys the same timeframe.

Scope of the audit: Clause 1 talks about an audit of ""Building Operating Costs of the preceding calendar year as well as the calculations of Tenant's Proportionate Share thereof."" Clause 2 says ""an audit of the Building Operating Costs from the prior calendar year, including the calculation of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of those costs."" So both cover the same elements—operating costs and their proportionate share.

Alternative provision: Both clauses offer an alternative where the Landlord can provide an audited statement. Clause 1 states ""Landlord may at its sole discretion provide..."" while Clause 2 says ""at the sole discretion of the Landlord...may be provided."" The wording is slightly rearranged but means the same thing—Landlord's discretion, prepared by a CPA.

Looking for any differences: The phrasing varies, like ""perform"" vs. ""conduct,"" and some word order changes, but the meaning remains consistent across both clauses. No additional obligations or rights are mentioned in one that aren't present in the other.

Are there any nuances I might be missing? For example, does ""at their own cost"" in Clause 2 imply something different than ""Tenant' expense""? Probably not; both mean the tenant pays for it. The structure of the sentences is slightly different, but they communicate the same responsibilities and options.

I don't see any discrepancies in the rights or obligations outlined. Both clauses are setting out the same procedure regarding audits, costs, timing, scope, and alternatives. Therefore, their meanings are the same.
