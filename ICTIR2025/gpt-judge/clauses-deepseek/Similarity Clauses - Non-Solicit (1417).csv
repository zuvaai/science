Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""NON-SOLICITATION."" It says that during the term and for one year after expiration or termination, neither party will employ, attempt to employ, or solicit employment of any employee of or consultant to the other party or induce others to leave. The comma before ""any"" is a bit unusual because it breaks the thought into two parts.

Clause 2 begins with the same structure: ""Non-solicitation."" But instead of ""Neither,"" it says ""Either"" and then modifies it as in ""either party may employ, attempt, or solicit..."" So the main difference here is between ""neither"" and ""either."" That makes me think they're contrasting actions. Clause 1 is about prevention, while Clause 2 allows for either party to perform.

I should consider if these are both about employment or if one talks about non-employment. But since they mention employees of the other party, it's about preventing someone from being employed by others. So the wording in Clause 1 uses ""Neither party,"" which implies that neither will do something. The second clause doesn't use that and allows either party to do it.

I'm also thinking about how ""solicitation"" is treated here. In Clause 2, they don't specify whether it's from one party or another; they just say any employee of the other party. So it's a broader statement, not restricted to one side. That means Clause 1 might be more restrictive.

In summary, Clause 1 is preventing someone from being employed by others, while Clause 2 allows either party to employ someone else. This contrast should make them different clauses.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 is called NON-SOLICITATION. It says during the term of the agreement and for a year after expiration or termination, neither party will employ, attempt to employ, or solicit employment with anyone else. So they're specifically talking about employees or consultants.

Clause 2 uses ""Restrictions on Hiring and Solicitation."" The full text is: For the duration of this Agreement and for one year following expiration or termination, neither Party shall hire, seek to hire, or solicit for employment any employee or consultant of the other Party. Additionally, they mention not attempting to encourage a termination.

Hmm, so both clauses have similar terms like hiring, seeking to hire, soliciting, employees, consultants, etc. The main difference is in the second clause's additional part: they explicitly say ""attempting to encourage, persuade, or otherwise influence"" which isn't in the first clause. That makes me think that the first one doesn't go into detail about influencing termination but the second does.

So, does ""soliciting for employment"" include both inducing someone to leave and encouraging their exit? Or is it separate terms? I believe they're distinct: non-solicitation would be not inducing or trying to induce, whereas hiring and solicitation could allow some influence. So the additional clause in Clause 2 makes them different.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me start by reading them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""During the term of this Agreement and for a period of 1 year after expiration or termination of this Agreement, neither party will employ, attempt to employ or solicit the employment of, any employee of or consultant to of the other party or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any employee of or consultant to leave the employ of other.""

Clause 2 says: ""During the term of this Agreement and for a period of 1 year after expiration or termination of this Agreement, either party may employ, attempt to employ or solicit the employment of, any employee of or consultant to of the other party or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any employee of or consultant to leave the employ of other.""

Hmm, at first glance, they both have ""NON-SOLICITATION"" as their title. That's a good start. Now, looking at the content.

Clause 1 starts with ""Neither party will..."" which means neither party can do these actions. Clause 2 starts with ""Either party may..."" which implies that either party can do these actions.

Wait, so in Clause 1, it's prohibiting both parties from doing certain things during and after the agreement term. In Clause 2, it's allowing either party to do those same actions. That seems contradictory because one is preventing and the other is allowing the same behavior.

But let me read more carefully. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's break down each part.

Clause 1: Neither party will employ, attempt to employ, or solicit others from the other party's employees or consultants. They also won't induce others to leave the other's employment.

Clause 2: Either party may employ, attempt to employ, or solicit others from the other party's employees or consultants. And they can induce others to leave as well.

So in Clause 1, it's a restriction on both parties not to do these things. In Clause 2, it's allowing either party to do these things. That would mean that one clause is prohibiting and the other is allowing the same actions. So they are opposites of each other.

Wait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check if the wording is exactly opposite. In Clause 1, ""Neither party will..."" which is a prohibition. In Clause 2, ""Either party may..."", which is permission. So yes, one is saying it's not allowed, and the other says it's allowed.

Therefore, they are different because one restricts both parties from doing something, while the other allows either party to do that same something. That seems like a significant difference in meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 is titled ""NON-SOLICITATION."" It says that during the term of the agreement and for a year after it ends, neither party can employ, attempt to employ, or solicit the employment of any employee or consultant of the other party. They also can't induce or try to induce an employee or consultant to leave.

Clause 2 is titled ""Restrictions on Hiring and Solicitation."" It states that for the duration of the agreement and one year after it ends, neither party can hire, seek to hire, or solicit employment for any employee or consultant of the other. Additionally, they can't attempt to encourage, persuade, or influence employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the other party.

Looking at both clauses, they both forbid hiring or soliciting someone from the other party's employees or consultants within a year after the agreement ends. They also mention not trying to induce an employee to leave in Clause 1 and not persuading them to terminate their employment in Clause 2. 

Wait, but in Clause 2, there's another part about attempting to encourage or persuade employees to leave. In Clause 1, it's about inducing them to leave. So both clauses cover similar actions but maybe with slightly different verbs. ""Induce"" and ""persuade"" can be seen as similar in meaning. They both prevent the party from taking actions that would interfere with the other's workforce.

So, both clauses are restricting the same behaviors for the same duration after the agreement ends. The wording might differ slightly, but the intent is the same. Therefore, I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me take a look at each one carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Neither party will employ, attempt to employ or solicit the employment of, any employee..."" and it goes on to say they can't induce them to leave. So this is like saying both parties agree not to poach each other's employees for a year after the agreement ends.

Clause 2 starts similarly but then says: ""Either party may employ, attempt to employ or solicit..."" which sounds opposite. This one seems to allow either side to recruit the other's staff, which is the opposite of Clause 1.

Wait, so Clause 1 prohibits solicitation while Clause 2 allows it? That means they have completely different meanings. One restricts hiring each other's employees, and the other allows it. So definitely, they are not the same.

Clause 1 says: Neither party will employ, attempt to employ, or solicit the employment of any employee or consultant of the other party. It also mentions inducing or attempting to induce employees or consultants to leave their current position during the term and for a year after.

Clause 2 states: Neither Party shall hire, seek to hire, or solicit for employment any employee or consultant of the other Party. Additionally, they can't attempt to encourage, persuade, or influence such individuals to terminate their relationship with the other Party. This also applies during the agreement's term and for a year after.

Comparing both clauses, they both restrict hiring or soliciting employees and consultants of the other party during the agreement and for a year post-termination. The wording is slightly different, but the meaning seems consistent. Clause 2 adds ""terminate their relationship"" which might include more than just employment, like consultant contracts, but that's covered in both.

So, they seem to have the same intent and restrictions.

Clause 1 says: ""Neither Party shall make disparaging remarks about each other, nor shall they use these repair calls as the basis for internal referrals or to solicit customers to market services.""

Clause 2 says: ""Either Party may make disparaging remarks about each other, and may use these repair calls as the basis for internal referrals or to solicit customers to market services.""

Hmm, at first glance, both clauses mention making disparaging remarks and using repair call information. But I notice a key difference in Clause 1. It says ""Neither Party"" which sounds like it's excluding both parties together. Then in Clause 2, it says ""Either Party,"" meaning one party or the other is allowed to do these actions.

Wait, so in Clause 1, it's saying that neither can make those remarks, and also not use repair calls for internal referrals. That makes sense because ""Neither"" implies both parties are prohibited from doing both things.

In Clause 2, though, it says each party can make disparaging remarks (either one or the other) and also be able to use repair calls. So in Clause 1, neither is allowed to do anything related to internal referrals or market solicitations because they cannot even mention each other. In Clause 2, both parties are more flexible—each has the right to do those actions.

I think that's the difference. So unless there's some nuance I'm missing about how these clauses work legally, I believe they're different in meaning.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. So I have two legal clauses here, and I need to determine if they're the same, different, or unsure. 

First, looking at Clause 1: It says neither Party should make disparaging remarks about each other when responding to repair calls. And it also prohibits them from using these calls for internal referrals or market solicitation. So that part is pretty straightforward.

Now, Clause 2 mentions both parties agreeing not to make negative statements and then again specifies that they can't use the service interactions for generating internal referrals or marketing their own services. Wait a second, the first time it says ""to solicit customers,"" but now it's ""solicit customers."" Is there a difference in meaning here? I don't think so because ""soliciting"" means soliciting something, like providing service. So that part is similar.

Both clauses mention prohibited actions regarding negative statements and using calls or interactions for internal referrals or marketing. The only slight change is the phrasing of one word from ""s solicit"" to ""solicit,"" but it's just a grammatical variation. That shouldn't affect whether they mean the same thing.

So putting it all together, both clauses are saying the same thing in slightly different wording. Therefore, I think they're the same.

Clause 2 is a bit different. It states that either Party may make disparaging remarks, and they may use the repair calls for internal referrals or soliciting customers.

Hmm, so in Clause 1, both Parties are prohibited from making negative remarks and using repair calls in certain ways. In Clause 2, it seems like each Party has permission to do those things. So in Clause 1, it's a restriction, while in Clause 2, it's allowing the behavior.

Wait, but in legal terms, ""neither"" and ""either"" can have different implications. ""Neither"" typically means neither one nor the other, so both are prohibited. ""Either"" usually means either one or the other, so they each have permission.

So Clause 1 is a restriction on both parties not to do those things. Clause 2 allows each party to do them. That's a significant difference because in one case it's about prohibition and the other about permission.

Therefore, their meanings are different.

Hmm, both clauses talk about avoiding negative comments and not using repair situations for referrals or marketing. The terms are almost the same—Clause 1 uses ""repair calls,"" while Clause 2 says ""repair requests"" and refers more generally to ""service interactions."" But essentially, they're covering the same scenarios. 

I think the intent is identical in both clauses: prevent negativity between parties during repairs and stop using those opportunities for referrals or marketing. So, despite minor wording differences, their meanings are the same.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""No Solicitation."" The Executive must not directly or indirectly solicit or take away any person then employed by Emeritus for employment purposes with him, consulting relationship, or any other entity during the term of the Agreement.

Clause 2 is similar but uses ""may"" instead of ""must."" It also states: ""No Solicitation. Executive may... same things as in Clause 1.""

Hmm, at first glance, they look almost identical except for the choice words ""must"" and ""may."" I know that in legal terms, these can sometimes mean different things depending on context.

I should consider if ""must"" implies obligation with certainty, while ""may"" is more about possibility. But both clauses are about prohibited actions by the Executive not involving solicitations.

Wait, does ""executive may"" allow for exceptions? Or are they using similar meanings here? In some cases, ""may"" can mean it's permissible sometimes, but here, the original sentence in Clause 1 uses ""must,"" which is stronger. So maybe both clauses have a ""must"" clause, making them the same in meaning.

But I'm not entirely sure because ""may"" doesn't inherently make it the same as ""must."" They could both mean prohibited actions, so they might be considered the same. Alternatively, if one uses ""must"" and the other ""may,"" depending on context, but here they seem to have the same connotations.

Wait, maybe not. Because in some jurisdictions, ""may"" can include possibilities, whereas ""must"" is definitive. But in this case, both clauses are enforcing the same prohibited actions with similar language. So perhaps they are the same.

Clause 1 says: ""No Solicitation. Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit or take away, or attempt to solicit or take away, any person then employed by Emeritus for purposes of employment by or any consulting relationship with Executive or any other person, firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity during the term of this Agreement.""

Clause 2 says: ""Restriction on Solicitation
During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall not, whether directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit, or attempt to induce any individual currently employed by Emeritus to leave their employment in order to engage in work with the Executive or any other individual, business, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or entity in an employment or consulting capacity.""

Hmm, so both clauses mention solicitation and taking away. But they seem a bit different in wording.

Clue 1 uses ""no Solicitation"" which is pretty straightforward. It's just saying that the Executive shouldn't solicit anyone during the term. The other part talks about trying to take away someone, but it specifically mentions trying to induce an employee to leave. That makes sense because ""solicite"" and ""solicate"" can have slightly different connotations.

Clue 2 starts with a restriction on solicitation. It's similar in meaning but uses ""solicit,"" which is the past participle of ""solicate."" I think that might be a bit more formal or less direct, whereas Clause 1 uses ""no Solicitation,"" which is more neutral and clear about what isn't allowed.

Wait, so both clauses are prohibiting soliciting. The difference is in how they describe what's prohibited. One talks about taking someone away directly or indirectly, while the other talks about inducing an employee to leave because that would be a direct attempt to take them away. But I don't think they're different enough to be separate; they just describe the same prohibited actions differently.

So maybe they are considered the same? Or is there something else?

I should consider if ""solicitation"" vs. ""solicating"" makes a difference. No, they mean the same thing. The main difference is in the phrasing and nuance of how it's used, but the essence is the same.

Therefore, I think they are the same meaning.

Let me start by looking at Clause 1. It says that the Executive ""shall not directly or indirectly solicit or take away"" any person employed by Emeritus for purposes related to employment or consulting with the Executive or others during the term of the agreement. The key here is the use of ""shall not,"" which means it's a prohibition. So, the Executive can't do this.

Now, Clause 2 says that the Executive ""may directly or indirectly solicit or take away"" any person from Emeritus for the same purposes. Here, it's using ""may,"" which implies permission rather than prohibition. The Executive is allowed to do this.

So, in Clause 1, the action is prohibited, while in Clause 2, it's permitted. That makes them different because one prohibits the behavior and the other allows it.

Clause 2 is titled ""Restriction on Solicitation"" and says that during the term, the executive shouldn't directly or indirectly solicit, recruit, or attempt to induce any individual currently employed by Emeritus to leave their job in order to work with the executive or others in an employment or consulting capacity.

Hmm. Both clauses are about restricting the executive from soliciting employees of Emeritus. Clause 1 uses terms like ""solicit"" and ""take away,"" while Clause 2 explicitly mentions ""solicit, recruit, or attempt to induce."" 

I think the key difference is that Clause 1 also includes ""or take away"" which might imply not just trying to get them to leave but actually taking them away. But both seem to be covering similar ground—preventing the executive from poaching employees.

Wait, does ""take away"" add anything beyond just solicitation? Maybe it's more about the action of removing someone from their current position. So Clause 1 might include a stronger prohibition on not only trying to hire them but also actually taking them away, while Clause 2 is more focused on recruiting and inducing them to leave.

But in legal terms, sometimes these can be overlapping or used interchangeably. Both are about preventing the executive from interfering with current employees' employment. So perhaps they're essentially saying the same thing but phrased differently.

I'm leaning towards ""Same"" because both are restricting the same behavior—solicitation for employment or consulting purposes. The slight differences in wording might be just that, but the meaning is consistent.

Hmm, okay. The first thing I notice is that both clauses have the same title: ""No Solicitation."" That suggests they're about the same topic. But then looking at the verbs used, Clause 1 says ""shall not"" while Clause 2 uses ""may."" 

So in legal terms, ""shall not"" typically means it's a prohibition or an obligation to refrain from doing something. It's like saying you are required not to do this action. On the other hand, ""may"" usually implies permission or allowance; it's optional.

In Clause 1, the Executive is prohibited from soliciting employees of Emeritus for employment or consulting during the agreement term. In contrast, Clause 2 seems to allow the Executive to do exactly that. That’s a big difference because one is saying you can't do something, and the other is saying you can.

So even though both clauses have similar structures and mention the same entities and activities, the verbs completely change their meanings. Therefore, they are different.

It mentions ""solicit or take away"" and includes an attempt to do so as well. The scope is about not poaching employees for any kind of work, whether it's direct employment or consulting.

Clause 2 is titled ""Restriction on Solicitation."" It states that the Executive cannot directly or indirectly solicit, recruit, or attempt to induce individuals currently employed by Emeritus to leave their jobs in order to engage in work with the Executive or another entity in an employment or consulting capacity. So it's similar but uses slightly different wording—like ""induce"" instead of ""take away,"" and mentions recruitment specifically.

Both clauses are preventing the Executive from poaching Emeritus employees during the agreement term for any employment or consulting roles. They both cover direct and indirect actions, including attempts. The difference is in some verb choices—""solicit or take away"" vs. ""solicit, recruit, or attempt to induce."" But essentially, they're restricting the same kind of behavior.

I think the core meaning is the same because both prohibit approaching Emeritus employees for other work opportunities. So even though the wording varies a bit, the intent and restrictions are identical.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or different meanings. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 says that during the termination or expiration of a lease, the tenant doesn't have to pay any extra costs from their own pocket and is allowed to cooperate with the landlord in making things smooth for the tenant. They mention retaining residents at the premises, not soliciting others to move elsewhere, etc.

Clause 2 states exactly what Clause 1 says but says that the tenant isn't required to cooperate to facilitate the transition. So it's essentially saying they don't have to do anything extra and don't need to cooperate for that purpose.

Wait, both clauses seem to be making a similar point about not needing to cooperate beyond what's necessary. Maybe they are saying the same thing? But I'm a bit confused because one is using ""at no cost"" and the other doesn't. Let me think again.

Clause 1 uses ""no cost to Landlord or successor operator,"" which implies that the landlord covers any extra costs, so it's more about responsibility on the tenant. Clause 2 says they're not required to cooperate beyond what's needed for the transition, without mentioning any additional costs.

So, in both clauses, the tenant is allowed to do their part without paying anything extra from their own pocket. The difference might be that one includes the ""no cost"" clause while the other doesn't. But since both are emphasizing not needing to cooperate beyond what's necessary for the transition, I think they mean the same thing.

Wait, but Clause 1 uses ""at no cost,"" which might imply that the landlord is covering any additional expenses. However, in Clause 2, it just says ""not required to cooperate,"" so maybe they're saying different things about why they can do that. But the main point is that the tenant doesn't have to pay anything extra and doesn't need to cooperate for the transition.

So, after thinking about this, I think both clauses are essentially saying the same thing: The landlord is not required to cover any additional costs beyond what's needed, but more importantly, they don't need to cooperate with the tenant during the lease termination for smooth operations. Therefore, their meanings are the same.

Clause 1 says that upon termination or expiration of the lease, the tenant must cooperate with the landlord without any cost.

So, the tenant has to keep people there and not move them elsewhere.

Clause 2 also talks about the same scenario: upon conclusion or expiration of the lease. The tenant is obligated to assist the landlord or any successor operator to ensure an orderly transition. This cooperation must be done without financial burden. It includes actions like maintaining current occupants and refraining from encouraging or initiating relocations to other facilities.

Looking at the key points, both clauses require the tenant to help with the transition after the lease ends. They must keep residents and not move them. There's no cost to the landlord in either clause. The wording is a bit different but seems to convey the same requirement.

I think they are similar because both mention retaining residents and preventing relocation. The structure of the clauses is slightly different, but the essence is the same. So, I would say they are the same.

Clause 1 says that when the lease ends, the Tenant has to cooperate with the Landlord to make the transition smooth. They don't have to pay anything, and specifically, the Tenant should keep residents there and not move them elsewhere. So it's a requirement for the Tenant to do these things.

Now, Clause 2 looks similar at first glance but has a crucial difference. It says that the Tenant is NOT required to cooperate. That’s a big change because instead of an obligation, it removes that obligation. The rest about retaining residents and not soliciting relocation is still there, but since the requirement is removed, it might mean the Tenant doesn't have to do those things anymore.

Wait, but I need to make sure. In Clause 1, the Tenant must cooperate, which includes keeping residents and not relocating them. Clause 2 states that they're not required to cooperate, so does that also mean they don't have to retain residents or stop relocation? Or is it possible that only part of the cooperation is removed?

Hmm, I think in legal terms, if the requirement to cooperate is lifted entirely, then all the obligations under that cooperation would no longer apply. So the Tenant doesn’t have to do anything to help with the transition, which might mean they can let residents leave or even encourage them to go elsewhere.

Therefore, these clauses are different because one imposes an obligation and the other removes it.

Either the Company, or any of its affiliates, or any person acting on its or their behalf (i) may have, within the six-month period prior to the date hereof, offered or sold the Offered Security or any security of the same class or series as the Offered Security or (ii) may have offered or will offer or sell the Offered Security by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c).

Wait a minute, that's quite different in structure. Let me compare each part.

Starting with ""No General Solicitation; No Directed Selling Effort."" vs ""General Solicitation; Directed Selling Effort."" That seems like a big difference because they have an equal sign there. In Clause 1, both clauses are combined without a semicolon, while in Clause 2, it's split into two parts separated by a semicolon.

Next, the second clause says that neither or one may have offered or sold, which suggests that each part is exclusive, meaning only one party can satisfy it if applicable. In Clause 2, both parts are listed as possibilities without being mutually exclusive. That means in this case, either could apply, not just the combination of both.

Then, regarding the scope, Rule 502(c) applies to the Offered Securities and any related security. So for both clauses, it's about offering or selling those securities under certain rules. The key difference is how they phrase the exclusivity and mutual exclusivity.

In Clause 1, since there are two parts combined without a semicolon, only one of them can be true at a time. In Clause 2, since each part is separated by a semicolon, both can be true independently. That means in Clause 1, both cannot be true simultaneously, whereas in Clause 2, they can.

So putting it all together: Clause 1 restricts the combination of two conditions to just one party only, while Clause 2 allows for each condition to apply separately. Therefore, their meanings are different because of how they handle the exclusivity and mutual exclusivity.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through each clause carefully.

Clause 1 talks about no General Solicitation and no Directed Selling Efforts. It says that the Company, its affiliates, and individuals acting on their behalf can't offer or sell the Offered Securities within six months before the current date. They also have to make sure they don't use general solicitation or advertising for this purpose under Rule 502(c).

Clause 2 is shorter; it just says that neither the Company nor its affiliates, including anyone acting on their behalf, have engaged in offering or selling the Offered Securities or any securities of the same class. It also mentions using any form of general solicitation or advertising for this within Rule 502(c). 

So both clauses mention not allowing General Solicitation and Directed Selling Efforts, but Clause 1 is more detailed about what isn't allowed—like specific actions like offering by general solicitation or advertising. Clause 2 just states that they can't engage in these activities at all.

I think the key difference is that Clause 1 adds details about prohibited means of selling, which makes it stricter. It's specifying not only that you can't do General Solicitation or Advertising but also that you have to follow a specific legal rule. Clause 2 doesn't mention any specific rules or actions beyond stating that you can't engage in these activities at all.

So they are different because Clause 1 imposes more restrictions on what can be done during the six-month period.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 are the same or different. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""No General Solicitation; No Directed Selling Efforts."" It then goes on to say that neither the company nor its affiliates, nor any person acting on their behalf have done certain things in the past six months. Specifically, they haven't offered or sold the Offered Securities or similar securities (part i), and they haven't engaged in general solicitation or advertising as per Rule 502(c) (part ii).

Clause 2 is a bit different. It starts with ""General Solicitation; Directed Selling Efforts."" Here, it says that either the company, its affiliates, or any person acting on their behalf may have done these things in the past six months. So part i allows for possible offering or selling, while part ii allows for general solicitation or advertising.

Wait a minute, so in Clause 1, they are explicitly not doing these things, whereas in Clause 2, it's allowing that they might be doing them. That seems like a direct contradiction. Clause 1 is prohibiting both general solicitation and directed selling efforts, while Clause 2 is saying that they may have done either of those.

So, if I break it down:

- Clause 1: Prohibits both ""No General Solicitation"" and ""No Directed Selling Efforts.""
- Clause 2: Allows for ""General Solicitation"" and ""Directed Selling Efforts.""

That's a clear difference. One is restricting, the other is permissive. So they can't be the same because their statements about what's allowed are opposites.

Okay, so I need to figure out if Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts with a title-like statement: ""No General Solicitation; No Directed Selling Efforts."" It then goes on to say that neither the Company nor its affiliates, nor anyone acting on their behalf, has within the past six months offered or sold the Offered Securities or any security of the same class. Additionally, they can't use general solicitation as per Rule 502(c).

Clause 2 has a similar title: ""Prohibition on General Solicitation and Directed Selling Efforts."" It states that in the six months leading up to now, neither the Company nor its affiliates have offered or sold the same securities. They also haven't used any form of general solicitation or advertising defined by Rule 502(c).

Comparing both clauses, they both prohibit general solicitation and directed selling efforts. They mention the same timeframe (six months prior), the same entities involved (Company, affiliates, anyone acting on their behalf), and reference the same rule (Rule 502(c)). The structure of the clauses is similar too; both start with a prohibition statement and then elaborate on what's prohibited.

I don't see any differences in the wording or intent. Both are clearly stating that general solicitation and directed selling efforts aren't allowed, and they're restricting the same actions within the same timeframe. So I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them carefully and compare.

Clause 1 says that neither the Company nor its affiliates, nor anyone acting on their behalf, has offered or sold certain securities within the past six months or by general solicitation. It uses ""Neither"" and negative verbs like ""has not,"" indicating a prohibition against such activities.

Clause 2 starts similarly but uses ""Either"" instead of ""Neither."" It states that the Company or its affiliates may have done those things in the past six months or may offer them through general solicitation. The use of ""may have"" suggests permission or allowance, which is the opposite of Clause 1's prohibition.

So, one clause prohibits certain actions while the other allows them. That means their meanings are entirely different.

Alright, so I need to determine if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1: It starts with ""No General Solicitation; No Directed Selling Efforts."" Then it says that neither the Company nor its affiliates, nor anyone acting on their behalf have done a couple of things in the past six months. Specifically, they haven't offered or sold Offered Securities or any similar class or series. Also, they aren't using general solicitation or advertising as defined by Rule 502(c).

Now Clause 2: It's titled ""Prohibition on General Solicitation and Directed Selling Efforts."" It says that in the six months before now, neither the Company nor its affiliates (including anyone acting for them) have offered or sold Offered Securities or similar securities. Additionally, they haven't used any general solicitation or advertising as per Rule 502(c), and won't use it either.

Comparing both clauses: Both prohibit offering or selling securities in the past six months, specifically regarding Offered Securities and those of the same class/series. They also forbid using general solicitation and advertising under Rule 502(c). The wording is slightly different but conveys the same prohibitions.

Clause 1 uses ""within the six-month period prior"" while Clause 2 says ""in the six months leading up to."" Both refer to the same timeframe. The structure is similar, just phrased differently. There's no mention of directed selling efforts in Clause 2, but looking back, Clause 1 includes that as well under ""No Directed Selling Efforts,"" which might be a slight difference. However, the main prohibitions on solicitation and advertising are present in both.

Wait, but in the initial response, I concluded they were the same. Maybe the absence of directed selling efforts in Clause 2 is an oversight? Or perhaps it's implied under ""general solicitation."" Alternatively, maybe the user considers directed selling efforts as part of general solicitation. But since Clause 1 explicitly mentions it and Clause 2 doesn't, there might be a slight difference.

However, upon closer reading, both clauses are about prohibiting certain methods of offering or selling securities, which includes general solicitation and advertising. The key elements match, so the overall meaning is the same despite minor wording differences.

Okay, I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says ""Indigo not to supply HP customers Indigo shall refrain from soliciting to supply OEM Consumable or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" It seems like it's stating a duty not to supply to HP customers but specifically prohibits inducing others to do so by supplying OE parts. So, this is about Indigo avoiding any actions that would lead other companies to buy from them for HP.

Clause 2 says ""Indigo to supply HP customers Indigo may solicit to supply OEM Consumable or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" This one is more about Indigo being obligated to supply to HP but allowing others to request OE parts. It's a broader statement, not as strict as Clause 1.

I think they are different because the first clause is more about avoiding inducing someone else to supply OE parts specifically for HP, whereas the second is about Indigo directly supplying and allowing others to request them without any prohibition.

Okay, so I have this question about two legal clauses and whether they mean the same thing or not. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read both clauses carefully to understand their content.

Clause 1 says: ""Indigo not to supply HP customers Indigo shall refrain from soliciting to supply OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" So this looks like a formal restriction on Indigo's conduct towards HP clients. They're specifically prohibiting Indigo from supplying to HP customers and explicitly stating they won't solicit to provide OE Ms or spare parts to those same clients.

Clause 2 is: ""Restriction on Supplying to HP Clients."" It states that Indigo is prohibited from attempting to provide OEM Consumables or spare parts to HP clients. Okay, so this seems similar but perhaps a bit more broad?

Now, I need to determine if these clauses are the same or different. Let's compare them.

Clause 1 uses the phrase ""Indigo not to supply"" and specifies that this applies to HP customers. It also mentions they can't solicit OE Ms or spare parts specifically for HP clients. So it's a direct prohibition on Indigo supplying to HP, which in turn excludes providing OEMs or spare parts from those same clients.

Clause 2 is broader. It says Indigo is prohibited from supplying to HP clients without specifying that this is in the context of OEMs or spare parts. It just mentions providing to HP clients, without qualifying who they are. So it's a general restriction rather than being specifically tied to the type of goods.

So, Clause 1 has more specific terms and conditions, while Clause 2 is less detailed but still prohibits Indigo from supplying to HP clients. Therefore, I think they are different because one is more specific about the products or types (OEMs vs. spare parts) that it's excluding, whereas the other is more general.

Clause 2 states, ""Indigo to supply HP customers. Indigo may solicit to supply OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" Hmm, this one says that Indigo can approach HP customers for the same items.

Wait, but looking closer at the verbs used: Clause 1 uses ""shall refrain from,"" which is a strong prohibition. Clause 2 uses ""may solicit,"" which actually allows them to do it. So even though both are about Indigo and HP customers, one is a clear no and the other is an okay.

So, they're actually opposite in meaning. One prohibits the action, the other permits it. Therefore, they have different implications.

Clause 2: ""Restriction on Supplying to HP Clients. Indigo is prohibited from attempting to provide OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to clients of HP."" Again, this seems similar—it's about preventing Indigo from supplying these items to HP's clients.

The key parts are the actions restricted: both clauses mention not supplying OEM Consumables or Spare Parts to HP Customers/Clients. The wording is slightly different in structure but conveys the same prohibition.

So, I think they have the same meaning because both prohibit the same action towards HP customers. Therefore, the answer should be ""Same"".

Clause 1 says: ""Indigo not to supply HP customers Indigo shall refrain from soliciting to supply OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" So, this is telling Indigo that they shouldn't be supplying these parts to HP's customers. It uses ""shall refrain"" which means they must stop doing it.

Clause 2 says: ""Indigo to supply HP customers Indigo may solicit to supply OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" Here, it's saying the opposite. Indigo is allowed to supply these parts to HP customers because it uses ""may solicit,"" indicating permission.

So one clause prohibits supplying to HP customers, while the other allows it. That means they're not the same at all; in fact, they're opposites.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read both carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""Indigo not to supply HP customers Indigo shall refrain from soliciting to supply OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to HP Customers."" So, this is telling Indigo that they shouldn't supply HP customers with these specific parts and consumables. The language here uses ""shall refrain"" which sounds like a strict instruction.

Clause 2 is titled ""Restriction on Supplying to HP Clients"" and states: ""Indigo is prohibited from attempting to provide OEM Consumables or OEM Spare Parts to clients of HP."" Here, it's saying Indigo can't try to supply these items to HP's clients. The word ""prohibited"" also seems strong, similar in tone to ""shall refrain.""

Looking at the key terms: both clauses mention Indigo, HP customers or clients, and preventing them from supplying OEM Consumables or Spare Parts. The verbs used are different—Clause 1 uses ""refrain from soliciting,"" while Clause 2 says ""prohibited from attempting."" But I think these verbs have similar meanings in this context. Both imply that Indigo shouldn't take any actions to supply those items.

I don't see any differences in the prohibited activities or who is being restricted. The wording is slightly different, but the intent seems identical. So, they must mean the same thing.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or different meanings. Let me start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""NON-SOLICITATION Except as expressly permitted in any related agreement the Parties agree not to solicit the other Party’s employees for employment."" And it also states that public advertisements or postings of job openings aren't considered solicitation hereunder.

Clause 2 is similar but starts with ""Except as expressly prohibited in any related agreement"". So instead of saying they won't solicit, it says they may solicit. Then, both clauses mention that public stuff isn't considered solicitation.

Hmm, so the main difference seems to be whether they're saying not to solicit or allow it. But then, looking deeper, the second part is the same: ""public advertisements or postings of job openings in the ordinary course of a Party’s business are not considered solicitation hereunder."" So both clauses agree on that part.

In the first clause, they explicitly say ""not to"", which I think means they strictly disallow it. In the second, it's ""may"" instead, so more lenient. But wait, in some contexts, ""may"" can be used interchangeably with ""can"" or ""it is allowed"". If that's the case, maybe there's some nuance here.

But I think both clauses are using ""not considered solicitation"", which might imply that in all cases, such postings aren't allowed. So even if they differ on whether to prohibit or allow, the part about not considering them as solicitations is the same. That suggests that the overall meaning is similar because the exception is applied equally.

So putting it together, both clauses are saying something like ""You cannot request people for employment through public advertising in this context,"" but one says you can't do it at all and the other says maybe you can. But the core part of what's not considered solicitation remains the same.

I'm leaning towards they mean the same thing because only the explicit prohibition or allowance differs, which are both about excluding certain kinds of material. The rest is standard in legal clauses.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them again carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""NON-SOLICITATION Except as expressly permitted."" So it's saying that unless they follow a specific agreement, they shouldn't solicit others' employees. Then, it adds another part: public ads or postings of job openings aren't considered solicitation hereunder. That means they're explicitly excluding these types of communications.

Clause 2 says ""Prohibition on Employee Solicitation."" It mentions that unless explicitly allowed by a relevant agreement, they won't do this. And then, it adds the same thing about not considering public job postings as solicitation. So both clauses say that if there's a specific agreement, you can solicit employees; otherwise, you shouldn't.

So comparing them, both are about forbidding external hires unless an explicit agreement says otherwise. They just state the exclusions differently—clause 1 uses ""Except as expressly permitted,"" while clause 2 says ""Prohibition on Employee Solicitation."" The key difference is the wording of the exclusions but they cover the same fundamental concept.

I think they're considered the same because both clauses are enforcing a policy that prohibits solicitations unless an agreement authorizes it. So, yes, they have the same meaning.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""NON-SOLICITATION"" and says that except as permitted in any related agreement, the parties agree not to solicit the other party's employees for employment. It also mentions that public advertisements or postings aren't considered solicitation under this clause.

Clause 2 is similar in structure but uses ""prohibited"" instead of ""permitted."" So it says except as expressly prohibited, they may solicit each other's employees. Wait, that seems contradictory because if something is prohibited, then may is conflicting. But then the second part about public postings still applies.

Wait, so Clause 1 prohibits solicitation unless allowed by another agreement and doesn't consider regular business postings as solicitation. Clause 2 says they ""may"" solicit except where it's prohibited in a related agreement. Hmm, that might mean that under Clause 2, there's an allowance to solicit unless forbidden, which contradicts the first clause.

But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me break it down. Clause 1 prohibits solicitation without permission and says public postings aren't considered solicitation. Clause 2 allows solicitation except where prohibited and also states that public postings aren't considered solicitation. So both are saying that public ads aren't soli, but the first doesn't allow it unless agreed upon, while the second might be implying that it's allowed.

Wait no, in Clause 1, they agree not to solicit except as permitted, so if a related agreement allows it, they can. In Clause 2, they may solicit except where prohibited by another agreement. So both clauses are about allowing or prohibiting based on other agreements but the starting points differ: one starts with ""not to"" unless allowed, the other starts with ""may"" unless prohibited.

So, if a related agreement prohibits it in Clause 2, then it's not allowed. But in Clause 1, if an agreement allows it, they can. It seems like both are about whether you can solicit based on another agreement but one is more restrictive or permissive depending on the wording.

But looking deeper, the main point is that both allow public postings as non-solicitation. So maybe despite the initial difference in wording, their effect is similar. But I'm a bit confused because Clause 1 says they ""agree not to"" unless allowed, while Clause 2 allows them to ""may"" unless prohibited.

Wait, so if in Clause 1, they can't solicit unless another agreement says they can. In Clause 2, they can unless another agreement says they can't. So the only difference is whether it's an express permission or prohibition. But both end up allowing public postings regardless because that part is the same.

But the core of the non-solicitation is different: one starts with not to, the other allows. So they might actually have opposite effects depending on the agreements. If a party wants to prevent others from soliciting unless allowed by another agreement, Clause 1 is stricter. But if they want to allow it unless prohibited, then Clause 2 is permissive.

So perhaps their meanings are different because one prohibits without permission and the other allows unless forbidden. Therefore, they have different implications.

Okay, I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 is titled ""NON-SOLICITATION"" and says that except as allowed in any related agreement, the parties agree not to solicit each other's employees for employment. It also mentions that public advertisements or postings from a party's business aren't considered solicitation under this clause.

Clause 2 is titled ""Prohibition on Employee Solicitation."" The parties mutually agree to refrain from soliciting each other's employees unless allowed by a relevant agreement. Additionally, they acknowledge that general job ads or public postings don't count as solicitation here.

Both clauses start with similar language: the parties agree not to solicit each other's employees. They both mention that any related agreements might allow such actions. Both also specify that regular business-related job postings aren't considered solicitation under their respective clauses.

I notice that Clause 1 uses the term ""non-solicitation"" and talks about employees, while Clause 2 does something similar but with a slightly different structure. The key difference seems to be in how they explain exceptions: Clause 1 mentions ""related agreements,"" whereas Clause 2 refers to ""relevant agreements."" That might be semantic, but it could also imply that the scope of what's considered an exception is different.

Also, looking at the examples given, both clauses exclude general job postings as not constituting solicitation. The structure and wording are quite similar, just phrased slightly differently. There doesn't seem to be a significant difference in the substance beyond minor wording variations.

So, even though there's a slight difference in how they phrase exceptions (""related"" vs ""relevant""), the overall meaning is that neither party can solicit the other's employees for jobs unless allowed by some agreement. The examples provided also align between the clauses, reinforcing that they're meant to prohibit such solicitation but allow it under certain conditions.

Therefore, I think both clauses have the same meaning because they're addressing the same topic and using equivalent language.

Clause 2 says: ""Except as expressly prohibited in any related agreement, the Parties agree they may solicit the other Party’s employees for employment."" This seems different because it allows them to solicit unless it's forbidden.

Wait, the first clause is a restriction—don't solicit unless permitted. The second is permissive—they can do it unless prohibited. That changes the meaning entirely. So one is saying ""do not"" and the other is saying ""you may"".

Also, both say that public ads aren't considered solicitation, so that part is same.

So overall, the main difference is whether they are allowed or restricted from soliciting each other's employees. Therefore, these clauses have opposite meanings.

Alright, let's break down these two legal clauses to see if they mean the same thing or not. 

Starting with Clause 1: ""In no event shall the operators or employees of the Advertisers engage in high pressure salesmanship’ in the solicitation or marketing to customers."" So, this one seems negative. It explicitly states that you can't engage in high-pressure salesmanship when soliciting or marketing. There's a strong emphasis on disallowing it.

Now looking at Clause 2: ""The operators or employees of the Advertisers may engage in high pressure salesmanship’ in the solicitation or marketing to customers."" This one is more neutral. It allows them to do so, which means they are permitted to engage in high-pressure salesmanship under these conditions. 

So comparing both clauses, one explicitly prohibits engagement (negative), and the other prohibits disengagement (also negative). Both essentially mean that they can't use this specific technique during marketing. Therefore, they have the same meaning.
</think>

Different","

Different","<think>
Okay, so I have these two legal clauses to analyze and see if they mean the same thing. Let me try to break them down one by one.

First up is Clause 1: ""In no event shall the operators or employees of the Advertisers engage in high pressure salesmanship” in the solicitation or marketing to customers. The wording here seems pretty straightforward. It's saying that in all situations, there shouldn't be any high-pressure salesmanship involved during solicitation or marketing.

Then we have Clause 2: ""Prohibition on Aggressive Sales Tactics"". This one sounds more formal and uses a phrase like ""aggressive sales tactics."" The structure is similar—no use of ""engage"" but instead, the prohibited action is about aggressive tactics. It's not specifying who the employees or operators are but focusing on what they do.

Comparing the two clauses, both talk about preventing high-pressure interactions during solicitation and marketing. They both mention the prohibition on something related to sales tactics—aggressive ones in clause 1 and formal terms in clause 2. So, at first glance, they seem to convey similar meanings.

But wait, ""high pressure salesmanship"" is a bit more specific, using the term ""salesmanship,"" which I think refers to the techniques or style of sales. The second clause just says ""aggressive sales tactics,"" which might not be as specific in terms of what exactly it's prohibiting—maybe any aggressive approach regardless of the technique.

So even though the prohibited behavior is similar, the wording in Clause 2 uses a more formal and general term (""sales tactics"") rather than ""salesmanship."" That could mean that the forbidden actions are broader or slightly different. 

I think both clauses are aiming to prevent sales tactics that could harm customers, but they might be using slightly different language. But when it comes to legal purposes, where these clauses are used, the intent is likely similar: preventing high-pressure interactions during solicitation and marketing.

However, maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. For example, in Clause 1, ""high pressure salesmanship"" could imply that the employees have a very convincing or direct method of selling without considering customer needs. In contrast, Clause 2 is more abstract—aggressive tactics can include a variety of methods.

But when translating into legal terms, where precision matters, both clauses are probably intended to be interpreted similarly but with slight differences in wording. So overall, they might still mean the same thing from a legal standpoint.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me read them carefully again.

Clause 1 says, ""In no event shall the operators or employees of the Advertisers engage in high pressure salesmanship” in the solicitation or marketing to customers.""

Clause 2 is, ""The operators or employees of the Advertisers may engage in high pressure salesmanship” in the solicitation or marketing to customers.""

Hmm, so Clause 1 is a prohibition. It's saying that under no circumstances should they do high-pressure sales tactics. They can't engage in it at all.

Clause 2, on the other hand, allows them to do high pressure salesmanship. It says they may, meaning it's permissible or authorized for them to engage in this behavior.

So, one is a complete ban, and the other is giving permission. So, their meanings are opposite. They're not the same; they actually contradict each other. One restricts, the other permits.

Wait, maybe I should check if there's any overlap in wording that might imply they mean the same thing. Both mention ""operators or employees of the Advertisers"" and both refer to high pressure salesmanship in solicitation or marketing. But one is negative (no event) and the other is positive (may). So yes, they are opposites.

I don't see any situation where a prohibition would be considered the same as permission. They have directly opposite legal implications. Therefore, their meanings are different.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says, ""In no event shall the operators or employees of the Advertisers engage in high pressure salesmanship” in the solicitation or marketing to customers."" So this is a prohibition against using high-pressure sales tactics when advertising or marketing to customers.

Clause 2 states, ""Prohibition on Aggressive Sales Tactics. Under no circumstances may the personnel or representatives of the Advertisers employ aggressive sales techniques when reaching out to or promoting services to customers."" This also prohibits the use of aggressive sales methods, but it's phrased a bit differently.

Wait, in Clause 1, they specify ""high pressure salesmanship,"" which is a specific type of aggressive sales tactic. But Clause 2 talks about ""aggressive sales techniques"" in general. So while both are about prohibiting aggressive tactics, Clause 1 seems to focus specifically on high-pressure methods, whereas Clause 2 is broader, covering any kind of aggressive technique.

So does that mean they're the same? Or different? Because one is more specific than the other. I think they might be considered different because one is a narrower prohibition compared to the other's broader scope. However, in legal terms, sometimes words like ""aggressive"" can imply similar prohibitions even if not exactly the same terminology.

But wait, the wording in Clause 1 includes the phrase ""in no event,"" which makes it a strict prohibition in any situation. Clause 2 uses ""under no circumstances,"" which is also a strong prohibition but maybe not as explicitly strict as ""no event."" But the key difference is that Clause 1 mentions high pressure specifically, while Clause 2 refers to aggressive sales tactics more broadly.

So if someone violates Clause 1, they're definitely violating something related to high-pressure sales. But violating Clause 2 could cover a wider range of behaviors beyond just high pressure. Therefore, their prohibitions are on the same topic but with different scopes—one specific and one broader.

In legal terms, sometimes specific prohibitions can be considered subsets of broader ones, but in this case, since they're both about sales tactics being prohibited, but with differing terminology, I think they might still be seen as the same because the underlying intent is to prevent aggressive sales methods. However, a lawyer might argue that since one specifies high-pressure and the other is more general, they could have slightly different implications.

But considering the context, both clauses are about preventing certain sales tactics deemed unethical or unfair. So even if the wording isn't identical, their intended meaning is the same—to prohibit aggressive sales techniques.

Alright, let me try to figure out whether these two clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. So, Clause 1 says that ""In no event shall the operators or employees of the Advertisers engage in high pressure salesmanship in the solicitation or marketing to customers."" That sounds like a prohibition; it's saying they absolutely cannot do that under any circumstances.

Then, looking at Clause 2: ""The operators or employees of the Advertisers may engage in high pressure salesmanship in the solicitation or marketing to customers."" This one seems to be allowing them to do exactly what Clause 1 is prohibiting. The first clause uses a strong negative (""In no event shall""), while the second allows it with ""may.""

So, putting that together, one is saying they can't engage in high-pressure salesmanship, and the other says they can. That definitely seems like opposite meanings. Therefore, they must be different from each other.

Alright, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me take a closer look at each one.

Clause 1 says: ""In no event shall the operators or employees of the Advertisers engage in high pressure salesmanship” in the solicitation or marketing to customers."" Okay, so this is prohibiting operators and employees from using high-pressure sales tactics when they're trying to get customers interested in their services. The key points here are ""operators or employees,"" ""high-pressure salesmanship,"" and it applies during solicitation or marketing.

Clause 2 states: ""Prohibition on Aggressive Sales Tactics"" followed by ""Under no circumstances may the personnel or representatives of the Advertisers employ aggressive sales techniques when reaching out to or promoting services to customers."" This one seems similar. It mentions prohibiting aggressive sales tactics, and it's about personnel or representatives not using such techniques when they're contacting or promoting their services.

Now, comparing both clauses: both are talking about preventing certain types of sales methods. The first uses ""high-pressure salesmanship,"" while the second uses ""aggressive sales techniques."" I think these terms mean similar things—they both refer to forceful or pushy selling tactics that might be off-putting to customers.

The subjects are slightly different too: Clause 1 mentions operators and employees, whereas Clause 2 refers to personnel and representatives. Operators and employees could include a broader range of people involved in the operation, but personnel and representatives also cover those who interact with customers. So the groups being restricted seem comparable.

Looking at the activities they're restricting: solicitation or marketing in Clause 1, versus reaching out or promoting services in Clause 2. These phrases both describe the process of trying to attract customers, so the context seems similar.

So, putting it all together, both clauses are aiming to prevent sales tactics that are too forceful. They just use slightly different terminology but convey the same intent. Therefore, I think they mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through each clause carefully.

Clause 1 says: "" Contractor agrees that during the term of this Agreement, or any renewals thereof, and for a period of one year thereafter, it will not knowingly utilize information acquired from the business relationship with Quest Diagnostics to directly solicit business from Quest Diagnostics’ clients.""

Clause 2 is similar but uses ""may"" instead of ""will not"". So, clause 1 is about not using information knowingly, while clause 2 allows using it knowingly.

I think ""will not"" implies a negative intention or risk. If the contractor knows and will use this information, that might be considered a breach, which could lead to legal action. On the other hand, ""may"" doesn't have that implication; it's more of an offer or permission.

So, clause 1 is about excluding the possibility of using the info knowingly, while clause 2 allows it but doesn't exclude it. They're not exactly the same because one uses ""will not knowingly"" and the other uses ""may knowingly."" The meanings are somewhat similar but not identical.

It mentions soliciting within a period of one year after the agreement, but does it specify that it applies specifically to seeking solicitations from Quest Diagnostics or all clients?

Clause 2: ""No Solicitation Agreement."" It states throughout this Agreement and any extensions, as well as for one year following its end, the contractor refrains from directly approaching Quest Diagnostics' clients. The language here is a bit different; it starts with ""no"" which might be clearer, but both clauses seem to cover the same thing about prohibiting direct solicitations.

I think they're similar because both are emphasizing that the contractor must avoid using company information for solicitations. The main difference is in their wording and maybe the structure of the clause, but otherwise, the meaning is almost identical.

Looking at Clause 1: It says the contractor agrees that during the term of the agreement, or any renewals, and for one year after, it won't knowingly use information from their business relationship with Quest Diagnostics to directly solicit business from Quest's clients. So, they can't do this kind of solicitation.

Now, Clause 2: It says the contractor agrees that during the term, or any renewals, and for a period of one year after, it may knowingly utilize the information... to directly solicit business from Quest's clients. Hmm, so here, instead of not knowingingly using the info, it allows the contractor to do so.

Wait, but both are about non-solicitation. Clause 1 is prohibiting the use of acquired info for solicitation, while Clause 2 is allowing it? That seems contradictory. So, in one case, you can't do it, and in the other, you can. So their meanings would be different because one prohibits and the other allows.

I'm a bit confused because sometimes legal terms can be tricky. But here, ""may knowingly utilize"" suggests permission, while ""will not knowingly utilize"" means they must avoid doing so. Therefore, they have opposite intentions.

Clause 1 talks about non-solicitation. It says that during the term of the agreement, including any renewals, and for one year after, the contractor can't use information from their business relationship with Quest Diagnostics to directly solicit their clients. So it's about not using acquired info to target Quest's clients.

Clause 2 is titled ""No Solicitation Agreement."" It states that during the duration of the agreement, including extensions, and extending for one year after its conclusion, the contractor must refrain from directly approaching Quest Diagnostics' clients for business. The restriction is based on information gained through their professional relationship with Quest, which they shouldn't use knowingly for direct solicitation.

Hmm, both clauses are about contractors not soliciting Quest's clients after the agreement ends. They mention a one-year period post-termination where this isn't allowed. Also, both reference information acquired from the business relationship as the basis for the restriction on solicitation.

But I should check if there's any difference in how they're worded. Clause 1 uses ""knowingly utilize"" while Clause 2 says ""not be used...knowingly."" So they both include a prohibition against knowingly using the information. That seems consistent.

Another point is the timeframe: both cover during the agreement and for one year after. The only difference might be in how the restrictions are phrased, but I don't see a significant variation that would change their meaning. They seem to convey the same intent—prohibiting the contractor from using gained information to solicit clients after the agreement ends.

Wait, maybe the way they are structured is slightly different. Clause 1 says ""not knowingly utilize"" while Clause 2 says ""must not be used...knowingly."" But both are about avoiding intentional use of the information for solicitation. So it's more about intent in both cases.

I think the core meaning is the same: the contractor can't target Quest's clients with info gained from their professional relationship, and this applies for a year post-termination. There doesn't seem to be any contradictory wording here.

Hmm, so Clause 1 prohibits solicitation, while Clause 2 allows it. That seems like a big difference. One is saying they can't do something, and the other is saying they can. So they have opposite meanings.

I should make sure there's no trick here. The terms are almost identical except for that key word change. ""Will not"" versus ""may."" There's no ambiguity in those words. ""May"" implies permission, while ""will not"" implies a restriction. 

So yes, these clauses are definitely different because one forbids the action and the other permits it.

Alright, I'm looking at these two clauses and trying to figure out if they mean the same thing or not. Let's break them down step by step.

Clause 1 talks about a ""Non-Solicitation"" agreement where the Contractor can't use information from their relationship with Quest Diagnostics to directly solicit business from Quest's clients during the term, any renewals, and for one year after that. It specifically mentions ""directly solicit.""

Clause 2 is titled ""No Solicitation Agreement."" It says the same thing about the duration—during the agreement, including extensions, and a year after it ends. The Contractor can't directly approach Quest's clients using information gained from their professional relationship.

Looking at the key elements: both clauses cover the same timeframe, restrict direct solicitation of Quest's clients, and base this on information obtained through their business or professional relationship. They both mention that the restriction lasts for a year after the agreement ends.

The main difference I see is in wording—like ""directly approach"" vs. ""directly solicit."" But those phrases essentially mean the same thing in this context. There's no indication of any differences in scope or application between the two clauses. So, they're covering the same ground with slightly different phrasing but the same intent.

I don't see anything that suggests one is more restrictive than the other or covers additional scenarios beyond what the other does. Both are clear about the duration and the prohibited actions. Therefore, I conclude they have the same meaning.

 Clause 2: ""You have advised Company that you will approve any pro-alcohol or pro-tobacco advertisements or sponsors, and Company has agreed to solicit such advertisers or sponsors.""

Hmm, the main differences I can see are in two areas. First, what they're advising about approval. In the first clause, it's saying not to approve them, while the second one says you'll approve. So that part is opposites.

Secondly, what they agree to do changes too. The first one says not to solicit, and the second says to solicit. Again, opposite actions.

So putting it together, they both have the same advice on not approving the ads, but the agreement parts are different: not soliciting vs. soliciting.

Therefore, the clauses must be different because both statements address a common issue but in opposite ways.

Clause 2 states: ""You have informed the Company that you will refuse to endorse any advertisements or sponsorships promoting alcohol or tobacco. In response, the Company has consented to refrain from seeking out advertisers or sponsors associated with these products.""

Okay, both clauses start by advising the company and informing them of their actions. Then they mention refusing to approve/send endorsements for alcohol or tobacco ads.

Looking at the second part: Clause 1 mentions ""soliciting"" while Clause 2 says ""consenting."" I'm not entirely sure about the nuances here. 

""Soliciting"" can sometimes be used as a broad term, but in legal contexts, it often means inviting someone to engage in something. Here, the company is refusing to solicit advertisers or sponsors who promote alcohol or tobacco. So that part seems consistent.

But Clause 2 uses ""consenting,"" which might imply giving consent. In some cases, consented is used interchangeably with consents given. However, I'm not sure if ""consent"" and ""soliciting"" are the same in this legal context.

Wait, perhaps they're intended to mean the same thing. Both are indicating that the company has agreed not to seek out advertisers or sponsors. So whether it's referring to consent or soliciting, the meaning is similar because it means refusing to engage with such people.

Therefore, both clauses have the same intention.

Hmm. So in Clause 1, the person is telling the company they won't approve ads for alcohol or tobacco, and the company agrees not to seek those advertisers. In Clause 2, the advice is the opposite—they will approve such ads—and the company agrees to solicit those sponsors.

So the key difference is in the first part of each clause. Clause 1 is about not approving and not soliciting, while Clause 2 is about approving and soliciting. Therefore, they have opposite meanings.

Clause 2 says: ""You have informed the Company that you will refuse to endorse any advertisements or sponsorships promoting alcohol or tobacco. In response, the Company has consented to refrain from seeking out advertisers or sponsors associated with these products.""

Alright, let me break this down. Both clauses are about a company and someone (maybe an individual or another entity) discussing their stance on alcohol and tobacco advertising.

In Clause 1, the person is advising the company that they won't approve any pro-alcohol or tobacco ads or sponsors. Then the company agrees not to solicit such advertisers or sponsors.

Clause 2 starts by saying the person has informed the company they will refuse to endorse any ads promoting alcohol or tobacco. The company responds by consenting to refrain from seeking out those advertisers or sponsors.

So, both clauses are about a refusal to approve or endorse certain advertisements and the company agreeing not to seek such sponsors. They seem to be saying the same thing but in slightly different wording.

I'm trying to see if there's any difference in meaning. The first clause uses ""approve"" and ""solicit,"" while the second uses ""refuse to endorse"" and ""consent to refrain from seeking."" Essentially, both are about not allowing the company to have these advertisers or sponsors because they promote alcohol or tobacco.

I don't see a difference in the substance of what's being said. Both clauses are about mutual agreement where one party won't approve and the other won't seek out those sponsors. So I think their meanings are the same.

In Clause 2, it's the opposite. The person says they will approve such ads, and the company has agreed to go after those advertisers or sponsors. So here, both are in favor of promoting alcohol and tobacco products.

So one is about disapproving and avoiding those ads, while the other is about approving and seeking them out. That definitely makes them different from each other.

Clause 1 says: ""You have advised Company that you will not approve any pro-alcohol or pro-tobacco advertisements or sponsors, and Company has agreed not to solicit such advertisers or sponsors.""

So, from this, I understand that the person is telling the company they won't approve ads or sponsors for alcohol or tobacco. Then, the company agrees not to ask for those kinds of advertisers or sponsors.

Clause 2 says: ""You have informed the Company that you will refuse to endorse any advertisements or sponsorships promoting alcohol or tobacco. In response, the Company has consented to refrain from seeking out advertisers or sponsors associated with these products.""

Here, the person is informing the company they won't endorse ads or sponsorships for alcohol or tobacco. The company then agrees not to seek out advertisers or sponsors linked to these products.

Now, I'll compare both clauses step by step.

First, in Clause 1, it's about advising and not approving pro-alcohol or pro-tobacco ads or sponsors. In Clause 2, it's about refusing to endorse such promotions. So, ""advise not to approve"" versus ""refuse to endorse."" Are these the same? Approving and endorsing can be similar in this context because both involve giving permission or support for something.

Next, the company's response: In Clause 1, they agree not to solicit advertisers or sponsors of those products. In Clause 2, they consent to refrain from seeking out such advertisers or sponsors. ""Agree not to solicit"" versus ""consent to refrain from seeking."" These phrases seem synonymous because both mean the company won't approach or look for these kinds of advertisers.

Looking at the scope: Both clauses are about alcohol and tobacco. Clause 1 mentions advertisements or sponsors, while Clause 2 talks about sponsorships promoting those products. So, it's slightly different wording but covers the same categories.

Are there any nuances I might be missing? ""Pro-alcohol"" vs. ""promoting alcohol."" They both mean ads that support or encourage use of alcohol and tobacco. Similarly, ""sponsors associated with these products"" is another way to say pro-alcohol or pro-tobacco sponsors.

I don't see any differences in the obligations each party has. The person won't approve/endorse such content, and the company won't seek those advertisers or sponsors. So, both clauses are essentially stating the same agreements just using slightly different wording.

Clause 1 says: ""Party B shall not individually or jointly with other people... hire or engage, or for the purpose of hiring or engagement, induce or approach Party A’s employees, directors or managers..."" It uses words like ""shall"" and ""may,"" which are past tense. So it's a duty or obligation.

Clause 2 is written in the present tense: ""Party B may individually or jointly... hire or engage..."" It also talks about inducing or approaching someone related to Party A.

The key difference seems to be the tense of the verbs. One is using ""shall,"" which means ""to be"" (past perfect), and the other is ""may,"" which is ""might"" (simple past). Since these clauses are obligations, they should have the same meaning but differ in form. Using different tenses can affect compliance with laws that require specific tense conventions.

So, I think the main difference is the use of past perfect versus present simple tense. They're both duties, so their meanings are the same. But the structure and wording make them distinct in form.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 says that within the lease term and one year after, without the prior consent of Party A in writing, Party B can't hire or engage others directly or indirectly with their own employees. It mentions employees, directors, managers, or anyone Party A engaged as such. So it's talking about employees from Party A and their people.

Clause 2 is similar but says during the lease duration plus a year, without written permission, Party B must not employ employees independently or collaborate with others. It also prohibits inducing or approaching existing employees for employment purposes. 

The key difference seems to be who Party B can hire. Clause 1 specifically mentions employees of Party A and their people, while Clause 2 talks about any person involved by Party A in those roles. Since ""any"" is broader than ""employees"", I think they are different because Clause 2 allows for other individuals as well.

Clause 1 starts with ""shall not individually or jointly..."" So it's saying that without prior written consent of Party A, Party B shouldn't do these actions. It lists things like hiring or engaging directly or indirectly through others to approach Party A's employees, directors, etc. 

Clause 2 also starts similarly: ""without the prior consent... may individually or jointly..."" Here, instead of ""shall not,"" it uses ""may."" So the first part is a prohibition in Clause 1 and permission with conditions in Clause 2.

Wait, but let me look closer. Clause 1 says Party B ""shall not"" do those things. Clause 2 says they ""may"" do them only if they have prior consent. But actually, both clauses are about the same actions: hiring or inducing employees, etc., without prior consent. So in Clause 1, it's a prohibition; in Clause 2, it's a permission but with the condition of prior written consent.

So whether the clauses are the same depends on if they're prohibiting the same action versus allowing it with conditions. They seem to be opposite in structure: one prohibits without consent, the other allows only with consent. So their meanings might differ because one is negative and the other is permissive but conditioned.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Both clauses are talking about the same actions (hiring or approaching employees) during the lease term and a year thereafter. The difference is that Clause 1 uses ""shall not"" while Clause 2 uses ""may,"" implying that in one case it's prohibited without consent, and in the other, it's allowed but only with consent.

So the core action is the same—hiring or approaching employees—but the constraints are different. In one, you can't do it at all; in the other, you have to get permission first. Therefore, their meanings differ because they impose opposite obligations.

Clause 1 says that during the lease term and one year after, without prior written consent from Party A, Party B can't individually or jointly with others, directly or indirectly, hire or engage anyone who was an employee, director, or manager of Party A. It also mentions inducing or approaching any person whom Party A has engaged in those roles.

Clause 2 is a bit longer. It states that during the lease and for one year after, without written permission from Party A, Party B can't independently or through intermediaries hire or engage anyone who's an employee, director, or manager of Party A. Additionally, it prohibits enticing or approaching any person currently or previously contracted by Party A in those roles for employment or engagement.

Hmm, both clauses are about restrictions on Party B after the lease term and one year later. They both mention not hiring or engaging people from Party A's current or former employees, directors, etc. They also use similar language like ""individually or jointly with others"" and ""directly or indirectly."" Both specify that this applies without prior consent or permission.

Wait, in Clause 1, it says ""Party B shall not... hire or engage... for the purpose of hiring or engagement."" So it's about both actual hiring/engagement and the act of inducing someone to do so. Similarly, Clause 2 uses ""employ, engage, or attempt to employ or engage"" and ""enticing or approaching"" which sounds like trying to get someone to come on board.

So the restrictions in both clauses cover not just hiring but also attempting to hire, and both mention current and former employees etc. The key points are the same: Party B can't do these things without prior written consent from Party A for a certain period after the lease ends.

I don't see any differences in the wording that would change the meaning. Both clauses are aimed at preventing Party B from poaching or inducing employees of Party A either during the lease or within a year afterward.

Clause 2 states that during the lease and one year after, without written permission, Party B can't employ or engage any individual who is an employee, director, or manager of Party A. Additionally, Party B is prohibited from enticing or approaching anyone currently or previously contracted by Party A for employment purposes.

So both clauses have a timeframe: during the lease plus one year after. They both require prior written consent from Party A for Party B to take certain actions regarding Party A's employees, directors, and managers.

Clause 1 uses terms like ""hire or engage"" and mentions doing so individually or with others, through intermediaries, etc. It also includes attempting to hire or engage. Clause 2 says ""employ, engage, or attempt to employ or engage"" and adds that it applies whether done independently or in collaboration, directly or through intermediaries.

Clause 1's prohibition includes approaching for the purpose of hiring, while Clause 2 explicitly mentions enticing or approaching individuals for employment purposes. Both seem to cover similar actions: attempting to hire, engaging, or inducing others to leave Party A.

The main difference I see is that Clause 2 specifically mentions ""currently or previously contracted"" individuals, whereas Clause 1 refers to those engaged as employees, directors, or managers at the time of the lease term and one year after. But both clauses aim to prevent Party B from poaching Party A's staff during and after the lease.

So, despite some slight differences in wording, the core restrictions seem identical: not hiring or enticing any of Party A's relevant personnel without consent for a specific period.

Clause 1 is about ""No Solicitation of Transactions."" It says that a Stockholder cannot engage in any action prohibited by Section 6.04 if they solicit transactions. Then it outlines what specific actions they're prohibited from taking, like through officers, directors, agents, etc., and also mentions direct or causing representatives to not engage in prohibited actions.

Clause 2 talks about ""Solicitation of Transactions."" Here, the Stockholder may engage in such prohibited actions but specifically directs or causes their representatives and agents to do so. So it's a bit different because instead of prohibiting themselves from engaging, it allows them to engage when they solicit.

The main difference is who's prohibited from acting and what's allowed. In Clause 1, the prohibitions are on the Stockholder themselves; they can't do things if they solicit. In Clause 2, the Stockholder may engage in these actions after someone else (the solicitor) does so. So one allows direct action, the other prohibits it.

I should check if there's any overlap or anything that could make them similar. For example, both clauses mention that Stockholders are prohibited from engaging when they solicit, but one says ""not"" and the other allows. Also, in Clause 1, the prohibitions are through any officer, director, agent; in Clause 2, it's through someone who does the soliciting.

Wait, actually, in Clause 1, the prohibition is on the Stockholder themselves if they engage indirectly. In Clause 2, it's that the Stockholder may engage after the solicitor does so. So both involve actions prohibited when someone else does them. But the language is slightly different: ""not,"" ""may.""

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 is about No Solicitation of Transactions and Prohibition on Transaction Solicitation. It's broken down into subpoints (a) and (b). Point (a) says the Stockholder shouldn't engage in any actions prohibited by Section 6.04, and then point (b) adds that they should direct or cause representatives/agents not to engage in those same actions.

Clause 2 is just ""Prohibition on Transaction Solicitation."" It talks about not engaging in activities forbidden under Section 6.04 and ensuring their representatives don't participate in prohibited actions.

So, the main difference seems to be where each point comes from. Clause 1 has two subpoints: one for direct actions and another for causing those actions by others. The second point introduces liability or consequences if other Stockholders engage in prohibited solicitation.

Clause 2 is a bit more straightforward—it just lists the prohibition directly without separating into specific points about who can or must do what. It also doesn't mention the accountability or consequences that Clause 1 includes, like liability for other Stockholders.

I think they are similar but not identical because both relate to preventing transactions through solicitation by Stockholders. However, since Clause 1 specifies actions by themselves and by others, it's more detailed in its implications.

Hmm, looking at the titles alone, one prohibits solitation while the other permits it. Clause 1 uses ""No Solicitation,"" which implies forbidding such actions, whereas Clause 2 is about allowing solicitation of transactions.

Breaking down the content: In Clause 1, under (a), the Stockholder is prohibited from doing those actions, and under (b), they're also forbidden to direct others not to do them. Wait, no, actually in (b) it's about causing representatives not to engage in prohibited actions, so maybe it's more about preventing others from acting.

In Clause 2, under (a), the Stockholder may directly or indirectly engage in prohibited actions, and under (b), they can direct their reps to do the same. So this seems like allowing both the stockholder and their agents to engage in those actions.

So one is forbidding any prohibited actions, including directing others not to do them, while the other is allowing such actions and directing agents to do so as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes legal clauses can be tricky. Let me parse each clause step by step.

Clause 1: No Solicitation of Transactions.
- The Stockholder shall not engage in any prohibited action themselves (a) nor direct anyone else not to do them (b). So it's about both their own actions and preventing others from acting.

Clause 2: Solicitation of Transactions allowed.
- The Stockholder may engage in prohibited actions (a) and may direct their agents to do so as well (b). So they have permission to act themselves and encourage others to too.

So the key difference is that one prohibits both their own actions and influencing others, while the other allows both. Therefore, they are opposites in terms of permissions.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Clause 1: Prohibits the stockholder from doing prohibited actions themselves (a) and also from directing others not to do them (b). So it's about both their own actions and stopping others.

Clause 2: Allows the stockholder to do prohibited actions (a) and allows directing others to do so as well (b). So they can engage in these actions and encourage their reps to too.

So yes, one is forbidding certain behaviors, including influencing others not to act, while the other permits those behaviors. Therefore, they are opposites; thus, different.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 is titled ""No Solicitation of Transactions."" It says that the Stockholder shall not engage in any action prohibited by Section 6.04 of the Merger Agreement either directly or indirectly through officers, directors, agents, etc., and also ensure their representatives and agents don't do so as well.

Clause 2 is titled ""Prohibition on Transaction Solicitation."" The stockholder agrees not to engage in activities, directly or through others, that are forbidden by Section 6.04. Additionally, they must make sure their reps and agents don't participate in actions that contravene those prohibitions.

Now, looking at the wording. Both clauses start with the Stockholder agreeing not to engage in actions prohibited by a specific section. They both mention the same kinds of actors: officers, directors, agents, etc., and also require that their representatives and agents don't take part in such actions.

The main difference I notice is in the titles. Clause 1 is more about ""solicitation of transactions,"" while Clause 2 is ""Prohibition on Transaction Solicitation."" However, looking deeper, both clauses are prohibiting similar things: not engaging in prohibited actions listed in Section 6.04.

I'm thinking that even though the titles mention ""solicitation"" differently, the content seems to align because they're both about avoiding actions forbidden by the same section. The wording in the body of each clause is quite similar too—both talk about direct or indirect actions through various parties and ensuring others comply.

So, despite the slight variation in the title, their prohibitions are identical in scope and terms. Therefore, I believe they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses have the same meaning or not. Let me take a look at each clause carefully.

Clause 1 says that the Stockholder ""shall (a) not... engage in any action prohibited by Section 6.04..."" and also ""(b) direct... representatives and agents to not engage."" So it's using ""shall not,"" which is a mandatory prohibition. They can't do these actions, and they must make sure their people don't either.

Clause 2 uses different language: ""may (a) directly or indirectly... engage in any action prohibited..."" and ""(b) direct... representatives and agents to engage."" Here, ""may"" implies permission or allowance. It's saying the Stockholder is allowed to do these prohibited actions and can make their people do them too.

The key difference is the verbs used: ""shall not"" versus ""may."" The first prohibits, while the second permits. So they have opposite meanings.

Alright, I need to determine whether Clause 1 and Clause 2 have the same meaning or are different. Let me read each clause carefully.

Clause 1 says:
- The Stockholder shall not engage in any action prohibited by Section 6.04.
- They must direct their representatives and agents not to do so either.

Clause 2 states:
- The Stockholder agrees not to engage in forbidden activities directly or through others.
- Also ensures that representatives and agents don't participate in such actions.

Looking at both, they both forbid the Stockholder and their representatives from engaging in prohibited actions under Section 6.04. They use slightly different wording but convey the same restrictions. So, they seem to mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses from YEC are the same or different. Let me read through them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""YEC agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell any Products to any person or entity outside of the [Market or] Territory, and YEC further agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit orders for or sell any Products in any situation where YEC reasonably should know that the Products will be resold or exported outside of the [Market or] Territory.""

Clause 2 says: ""YEC agrees that it will directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell any Products to any person or entity outside of the [Market or] Territory, and YEC further agrees that it will directly or indirectly solicit orders for or sell any Products in any situation where YEC reasonably should know that the Products will be resold or exported outside of the [Market or] Territory.""

Alright, so the main difference seems to be the words used before the clauses. In Clause 1, the first part uses ""will not directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell..."" while in Clause 2, it's ""will directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell...""

I think the key word here is ""not"" versus ""will."" Let me break it down.

Clause 1: Not ... Further agreement.
Clause 2: Will ...

So, the first part of both clauses starts with a negative verb (""not""), but the wording before that (the further agreement) differs. In Clause 1, it's about not soliciting orders in specific situations, while in Clause 2, it's about directly or indirectly soliciting orders regardless.

I wonder if ""solicit"" is being used differently here. ""Not"" might imply a negative obligation, whereas ""will"" could suggest a future possibility. But I'm not sure how significant that difference would be compared to the word change itself.

The second part of both clauses talks about reselling or exporting products. It's in the same structure: ""YEC reasonably should know..."" So maybe the main difference is still just that one negative verb.

But wait, could ""solicit orders from"" mean a specific type of order, like a direct order? Or does it refer to any order? I'm not sure, but regardless, the difference in wording before the further agreement seems to be the primary point here.

So, overall, the main change is the use of ""not"" vs. ""will."" The rest of the clauses seem structurally similar except for this word choice.

Alright, so I've got these two legal clauses about YEC's obligations regarding selling products outside their market or territory. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at Clause 1: It says YEC won't directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell any Products to anyone outside the [Market or] Territory. That part seems pretty straightforward. It explicitly mentions ""person or entity,"" which is a bit more specific than just ""individual.""

Then it adds another condition: YEC will not solicit orders for or sell any Products in situations where reasonably, the Products should be resold or exported outside that territory. The key here is ""reasonably."" So even though the first part talks about selling to anyone beyond the territory, the second part specifies when they can't do this again.

Now, Clause 2 says YEC undertakes two things: not to solicit orders from or sell Products to individuals or entities beyond the [Market or] Territory, either directly or indirectly. That's a bit more general than the first clause because it uses ""either"" which doesn't specify a category, so it could apply to both people and businesses.

Additionally, YEC commits to not selling or reselling in scenarios where it expects the Products will be resold or exported outside the territory. So that part is the same as in Clause 1—the expectation of resale beyond their area.

So, comparing the two clauses: Both mention avoiding solicitations beyond their territories, but the first one uses ""person or entity,"" which adds specificity about individuals. The second is more general about both individuals and businesses.

Wait, but the specific part about reasonably expecting resale outside—since the clause 2's condition for that is just saying it's reasonable to expect resale, whereas Clause 1 specifies ""reasonably."" So perhaps that's a difference in wording.

But regardless of whether it's ""reasonably"" or not, if the main point is avoiding sales beyond their territories under certain conditions, then maybe they are similar. However, the first clause has more specifics about ""person or entity,"" which might indicate a different intent.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about that. But in general, they seem to be making the same assertion but with slight variations in specificity and wording.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses mean the same thing or not. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that YEC agrees they won't directly or indirectly solicit orders from outside their market or territory and also won't sell products in a situation where they know the products will be resold or exported outside. So, it's saying YEC is restricting themselves from doing those things.

Clause 2 is almost the same but with opposite wording. It says YEC agrees to directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell to people outside their market or territory and also to do so in any situation where they know the products will be resold or exported outside. Wait, that sounds like the opposite of Clause 1.

In Clause 1, it's about not doing these things, while Clause 2 is about doing them. So, one is agreeing not to act, the other is agreeing to act. That seems contradictory. So, they can't have the same meaning because one prohibits the actions and the other requires them.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. In Clause 1, it's using ""agree that it will not"" do certain things, while Clause 2 starts with ""agrees that it will directly or indirectly solicit orders..."" So yes, one is prohibiting those actions and the other is allowing them.

Therefore, they must be different because they're taking opposite stances on whether YEC can sell outside their market or territory.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read both clauses carefully to understand their wording and intent.

Clause 1 says:
YEC agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell any Products to any person or entity outside of the [Market or] Territory, and further agrees not to sell in situations where they should know the products will be resold or exported outside the market or territory.

Clause 2 states:
YEC undertakes not to solicit orders from or sell any Products to individuals or entities beyond the [Market or] Territory, either directly or indirectly. Additionally, YEC commits to refraining from soliciting orders for or selling Products in scenarios where it's reasonable for YEC to expect that such Products will be resold or exported outside the Market or Territory.

Now, comparing both clauses:

Both start with a commitment not to sell products outside the market or territory, either directly or indirectly. That part seems identical.

Next, Clause 1 adds a further agreement about situations where they know the products will be resold or exported outside. Similarly, Clause 2 uses ""scenarios"" and ""reasonable for YEC to expect"" which is essentially the same meaning—knowing that it's likely to happen.

So, both clauses are prohibiting sales outside the market or territory, either directly or indirectly, and also when they have knowledge that the products might be resold or exported. The wording varies slightly but conveys the same restriction.

I don't see any significant differences in their prohibitions or the conditions under which they apply. Therefore, I think both clauses mean the same thing.

So, this clause is about YEC agreeing NOT to do certain things. They won't sell products outside a specific market or territory, and they also won't sell in situations where the products might end up being sold or exported outside that area.

Now looking at Clause 2: ""YEC agrees that it will directly or indirectly solicit orders from or sell any Products to any person or entity outside of the [Market or] Territory, and YEC further agrees that it will directly or indirectly solicit orders for or sell any Products in any situation where YEC reasonably should know that the Products will be resold or exported outside of the [Market or] Territory.""

Wait a minute. This one says YEC WILL do those actions. So instead of agreeing not to, they're agreeing to do them. That's the opposite.

So, Clause 1 is about restrictions on selling outside the territory, while Clause 2 allows and perhaps requires selling outside. Therefore, their meanings are completely different.

Alright, I'm looking at these two clauses and trying to figure out if they mean the same thing. Let me break them down.

Clause 1 says YEC agrees not to solicit orders from or sell products outside the specified market or territory. It also adds that YEC shouldn't do this in any situation where they should know the products will be resold or exported outside that area.

Clause 2 mentions YEC undertakes not to solicit or sell beyond the same market or territory, directly or indirectly. Additionally, it says YEC won't do so if it's reasonable for them to expect resale or export outside the territory.

Hmm, both clauses are about restricting YEC from selling products outside a certain area and also in cases where the products might be resold or exported there. The wording is slightly different—like ""agrees"" vs. ""undertakes,"" but they seem to convey the same obligation. The structure is similar, just phrased differently.

I don't see any significant differences in what each clause is prohibiting. Both are about not selling outside the territory and avoiding situations where resale or export might happen. So I think they're the same.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them again carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""During the term of the Employee's employment and for six months after termination of such employment, Employee will not induce or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company and engage in any business which competes with the Company.""

Clause 2: ""During the term of the Employee's employment and for six months after termination of such employment, Employee may induce or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company and engage in any business which competes with the Company.""

Hmm, so both clauses are talking about the same things but use slightly different vocabulary. Let me break it down.

First, the main period mentioned is during employment and six months after termination. That's pretty clear and should be the same in both clauses.

Then, the part about inducing or attempting to induce someone. In Clause 1, it says ""will not,"" which sounds like an obligation. In Clause 2, it says ""may"" or ""may be permitted."" I think ""may"" is more of a possibility than an obligation. But wait, in legal terms, ""will not induce"" and ""may induce"" can sometimes have the same meaning if they both indicate that there's no risk or liability involved.

Also, the part about inducing someone who is an employee of the Company means it refers to employees within the company. The use of ""any business which competes with the Company"" seems consistent in both clauses.

So putting it all together, I think they're essentially saying the same thing but using different legal terminology for what's called an ""induction."" Whether it's a promise to not induce or the possibility of inducing, the intent is similar. Therefore, they should be considered the same.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read them again.

Clause 1 is about an Employee's employment. It says that during their employment term and six months after termination, they won't induce someone from the company (which I think means another employee) to leave the company. The induced person shouldn't engage in any competing business.

Clause 2 is a non-solicitation agreement. It's for the duration of the Employee's tenure plus six months post-termination, and it says the same thing about not persuading or inducing competitors. It seems pretty identical in wording.

Hmm, so they're both talking about preventing inducement of competitors during employment and after termination. They both specify ""competitors"" and ""any competing business enterprise."" So they seem to be saying the same thing.

I don't see any differences in meaning here. Both clauses are enforcing a non-solicitation agreement related to workplace discrimination or employment practices. So, I think they're the same.

Clause 2 states: ""During the term of the Employee's employment and for six months after termination...Employee may induce or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of the Company to leave and engage in any business which competes with the Company.""

Hmm, at first glance, they seem similar because both talk about the same time frame (during employment and six months after), the same subject (the Employee), and the same actions (inducing others to leave and compete). But I notice a key difference in the verbs used.

In Clause 1, the verbs are ""will not induce"" and ""attempt to induce,"" which are negative. So it's prohibiting the employee from doing these things. On the other hand, Clause 2 uses ""may induce"" and ""attempt to induce,"" which are permissive. It allows the employee to do those actions.

So, one is saying you can't do it, and the other is saying you can. That seems like a big difference in meaning. So they're not the same; their implications are opposite in terms of restriction versus permission.

Therefore, I think they are different because one prohibits the action while the other allows it.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me read both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 starts by saying that during the Employee's employment term and for six months after termination, the employee won't induce or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of the Company to leave and engage in competing businesses.

Clause 2 is titled ""Non-Solicitation Agreement"" and states that the employee will refrain from persuading or attempting to persuade any current employee to exit their position with the company and participate in a competing business enterprise, for the duration of employment and six months after.

Hmm. Both clauses are about employees not soliciting other employees to leave and go work elsewhere or start a competing business. The time frames are also similar: during employment and six months after termination.

The wording is slightly different though. Clause 1 uses ""induce"" or ""attempt to induce,"" while Clause 2 uses ""persuade"" or ""attempt to persuade."" Are these words synonyms here?

I think ""induce"" generally means to entice or encourage someone to do something, which can include persuading. So, they might be using similar concepts but different verbs. The actions are the same: trying to get employees to leave for a competing business.

The prohibited activities seem identical in both clauses—trying to get other employees to switch or start a competitor.

So even though the wording is slightly different with ""induce"" vs. ""persuade,"" the intended meaning seems to be the same. Both are about preventing the employee from recruiting or enticing others to leave and compete.

Therefore, I think they have the same meaning.

Clause 1 says: During employment and six months after termination, the Employee won't induce any Company employee to leave and work in a competing business. It uses terms like ""induce"" and mentions ""business which competes with the Company.""

Clause 2 is titled ""Non-Solicitation Agreement."" It states that during employment and for six months after, the Employee must not persuade or attempt to persuade any current employee to leave their position and join a competing business enterprise. Here it uses ""persuade"" instead of ""induce,"" but the structure seems similar.

Looking at the key points: both have the same time frame—employment plus six months post-termination. Both prohibit actions that would cause Company employees to leave for competitors. The verbs used are slightly different—""induce"" vs. ""persuade""—but they seem synonymous in this context. Also, the consequences are the same: engaging in a competing business.

I think the intent is identical in both clauses. They both aim to prevent solicitation of employees by the former employee for six months after leaving. The wording is just slightly varied but conveys the same restriction.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 is ""NON-RECRUITMENT."" It says that during employment and for 12 months after termination (except Change of Control Termination), the Executive cannot hire Ceridian employees who are from businesses under their management. It also prohibits the Executive from owning, managing, etc., any person connected to those businesses unless they're directly hiring or inducing them to leave. Plus, it doesn't preclude them from referring to someone else's qualifications.

Clause 2 is ""RECRUITMENT."" This one seems similar but uses ""may hire"" instead of ""during the term and for 12 months following termination,"" so I'm not sure if that makes a difference. It also includes the same prohibited terms, but it doesn't mention ""cannot hire"" at all.

So the main difference is in verb tense: one says ""will not directly or indirectly hire,"" while the other says ""may hire."" The rest of the clauses are mostly the same except for this distinction. Also, both clauses don't explicitly prohibit hiring but instead allow it under specific conditions. 

I think they're similar enough that we might consider them the same, even though the tense is different. But I'm not entirely sure if the tense change makes a big difference in interpretation here.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two clauses are the same or different. The user provided both a ""Clause 1"" and a ""Clause 2,"" which look pretty similar at first glance. Let me read through them carefully.

Starting with Clause 1: It talks about Ceridian's employees being hired by Executive in specific situations, like termination without Change of Control Termination. It also mentions prohibited entities for hiring, including businesses where the Executive had management responsibility. The key here is ""hired,"" which implies direct involvement, perhaps through any means.

Clause 2 is labeled as a ""Prohibition on Employee Recruitment."" It states that during employment and 12 months after termination, the Executive must refrain from hiring employees from businesses with managerial responsibilities. Again, this seems to focus solely on not hiring but doesn't mention being hired indirectly or through other means. The term ""recruitment"" is used here too.

So both clauses are about prohibited actions regarding employee hiring, specifically excluding hires from certain businesses and individuals involved in prohibited activities. They seem identical in content and purpose. There's no difference in meaning between the two because they both mention prohibiting Executive from hiring certain employees without mentioning if it's direct or indirect. The use of ""recruitment"" might imply that they're referring to hiring, but it doesn't change the nature of the prohibition.

I don't see any nuances in wording that would make them different. Both are emphasizing restrictions on recruitment actions by Executive and don't offer any exceptions beyond what's already stated. Therefore, I think these clauses have the same meaning.
</think>

deepseek-r1:8b,"<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether these two clauses are the same or different. So, I have Clause 1 and Clause 2 both under the RECRUITMENT section, but I need to check if they're saying the same thing.

Starting with Clause 1: It says that during employment and for 12 months after termination (unless it's a Change of Control Termination), the Executive can't directly or indirectly hire any Ceridian employees who are employed by businesses where the Executive had management responsibility. They also can't solicit those employees to leave Ceridian, nor can they own, manage, operate, or control any business that does such things.

Clause 2: It starts similarly but uses ""may"" instead of ""will not."" So, it says during employment and after termination (same time frame), the Executive may hire or solicit Ceridian employees from businesses they've managed. They can also own, manage, etc., entities that do these things. However, the same restriction applies about responding to references.

Wait a minute, in Clause 1, it's a prohibition: ""will not"" directly or indirectly do those actions. In Clause 2, it's permissive: ""may"" do them. That seems contradictory at first glance. But I should read more carefully.

Looking closer, both clauses mention the same restrictions: hiring Ceridian employees from businesses with Executive's past management, soliciting them, owning/controlling entities that do such things, and the exception about responding to references.

But in Clause 1, it starts with ""will not,"" making it a prohibition. In Clause 2, it uses ""may,"" which is more permissive. So, if you may do something, that's different from not being able to do it. However, upon closer inspection, the content of what they can or cannot do seems identical.

Wait, but both clauses are under the same RECRUITMENT section. Maybe one is the original and the other is a revision? Or perhaps they are contradictory because one prohibits and the other allows.

But no, looking again: Clause 1 says during employment and after termination (except Change of Control), the Executive ""will not"" do these recruitment activities. Clause 2 says during that same period, the Executive ""may"" do them. So, it's like flipping a switch from prohibition to permission.

However, upon reading more carefully, I realize that both clauses are actually similar in their content but use different verbs (""will not"" vs. ""may""). The prohibited actions are the same in both. Therefore, despite the difference in wording, the practical effect is the same: during the specified period, the Executive cannot (Clause 1) or may (Clause 2) engage in these recruitment activities.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if you may do something, it's allowed, but Clause 1 says you won't. So they are opposites. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps both clauses are intended to be the same, with one being a correction. Maybe Clause 2 is supposed to allow the Executive to perform certain recruitment activities while Clause 1 prohibits them. But that seems contradictory because if the content is the same but uses opposite verbs, they can't both be correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me break it down again.

Clause 1: Non-Recruitment. During employment and 12 months post-termination (except Change of Control), Executive will not do these recruitment actions.

Clause 2: Recruitment. It's using ""may"" instead of ""will not."" So, the Executive may do these actions, but in reality, they can't because it's prohibited by the first clause? Or are they separate?

No, each clause is standalone. So Clause 1 is a non-recruitment clause, while Clause 2 is a recruitment allowance. But that doesn't make sense because they're both under RECRUITMENT.

Wait, perhaps the titles are a clue. One is NON-RECRUITMENT and the other is RECRUITMENT. So one prohibits recruitment activities, and the other allows them. That would mean they are opposites in terms of effect. But that can't be right because both clauses seem to cover the same ground but with opposite permissions.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check the exact wording again.

Clause 1 starts with ""NON-RECRUITMENT. During... will not..."" So it's about not recruiting.

Clause 2 starts with ""RECRUITMENT. During... may..."" So it's about allowing recruitment.

So one prohibits, the other allows. That would mean they are different because one is a restriction and the other is permission on the same subject. Therefore, they can't be the same; they're opposites in terms of legal language.

But wait, that might not be accurate because both clauses are part of the same agreement, possibly intended to regulate recruitment activities differently. However, upon closer examination, both seem to address the same prohibited and allowed actions, just with different wordings.

Wait no, Clause 1 says ""will not"" do certain things, while Clause 2 allows ""may"" do similar or same things. So, in effect, they are conflicting because one prohibits and the other allows.

But perhaps it's a matter of structure. Maybe Clause 1 is the non-recruitment part, and Clause 2 is an exception or a permission within that restriction. Or maybe they are separate provisions.

Alternatively, perhaps both clauses are intended to be the same but use different verbs, making them effectively identical in meaning despite the wording difference.

I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of it as legal documents. Often, clauses can have similar prohibitions and permissions, so it's possible that despite the different starting words (""will not"" vs. ""may""), they are intended to cover the same ground but from opposite angles. However, in reality, they might be conflicting or redundant.

Wait, perhaps they are actually opposites. If one says you can't do something, and another says you may do it, they are contradictory. But in legal terms, sometimes clauses can have different scopes or contexts, so it's possible that despite the opposite language, their meanings align because of the way they're structured.

Alternatively, maybe one is a general rule and the other an exception, but given that both start with ""During..."" for the same time period, I'm not sure. It might be more accurate to say they are different because one prohibits and the other allows the same actions within the same timeframe.

But then again, perhaps in the context of the entire agreement, they are intended to mean the same thing, just phrased differently. So, maybe their intent is the same, making them ""Same.""

Wait, but if one prohibits and the other permits, that's a significant difference. Unless ""may"" is used permissively within certain conditions, while ""will not"" is an absolute prohibition. Therefore, they are different because one is a restriction and the other is permission on the same topic.

So, in conclusion, since one clause prohibits recruitment activities and the other allows them, they have different meanings.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or are different. Let me start by reading both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 is titled ""NON-RECRUITMENT"" and it talks about what the Executive can't do after employment ends. It says that for 12 months after termination, unless it's a Change of Control Termination, the Executive can't hire or try to hire any Ceridian employees from businesses they had management over. They also can't own, manage, operate, join, control, or consult with any entity that does this. But there's an exception if someone else asks for a reference, not their current employer.

Clause 2 is ""Prohibition on Employee Recruitment"" and it seems similar but let me check the details. It says throughout employment and for 12 months after termination (except Change of Control) that the Executive can't hire or directly engage in hiring Ceridian employees from any business they managed. They also can't solicit these employees to leave Ceridian. Additionally, they can't be involved with any entity that does these forbidden activities. Again, it's okay to provide references if asked, except by their current employer.

Looking at the content, both clauses mention a 12-month period after termination (excluding Change of Control), restrict hiring or recruiting Ceridian employees from businesses where the Executive had management responsibility, and prohibit owning, managing, etc., any entities involved in such actions. They also both allow providing references unless it's their current employer.

The only difference I notice is in the wording: Clause 1 uses ""indirectly"" hire or induce, while Clause 2 says ""directly engage in hiring."" But the overall restrictions seem similar because indirect hiring would still fall under not directly or indirectly. Also, both mention the 12-month period and the same exceptions regarding references.

I think the core prohibitions are the same in both clauses, so their meanings align.

Alright, let's take a look at these two clauses and see if they mean the same thing or not. 

Clause 1 starts with ""NON-RECRUITMENT"" and says that during employment and for 12 months after termination (except for a Change of Control Termination), the Executive can't hire Ceridian employees from certain businesses, solicit them for hiring, etc. It also lists several other restrictions on being connected to entities that would do such things. However, it does allow the Executive to provide references unless requested by their employer.

Clause 2 is titled ""RECRUITMENT"" and seems to state the opposite. It says the Executive may hire or solicit those employees, and can be involved with entities doing so. The only exception here is also allowing references as in Clause 1.

So the main difference is the wording: one prohibits recruitment activities while the other permits them. Therefore, these clauses have different meanings.

Clause 1 is titled ""NON-RECRUITMENT."" It says that during employment and for 12 months after termination (unless it's a Change of Control Termination), the Executive can't hire or solicit Ceridian's employees from businesses where the Executive had management responsibility. They also can't be involved in any way with entities that do this. It does allow the Executive to respond to reference requests unless it's from their own employer.

Clause 2 is titled ""Prohibition on Employee Recruitment."" It says the same thing: during employment and 12 months after, except for Change of Control Termination, the Executive can't hire or solicit employees from Ceridian in any business segments they managed. They're also prohibited from being connected with any entity doing such activities. This doesn't stop them from giving references if someone else asks, not their own employer.

Comparing both clauses, they seem to cover the same time periods, restrictions on hiring and soliciting employees, involvement with related entities, and exceptions for references. The wording is slightly different but conveys the same prohibitions and permissions. So I think they have the same meaning.

Okay, so I need to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let's start by reading both carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""NON-SOLICITATION."" It mentions that during the term of the Agreement and for two years after termination, non-renewal, the subscriber shouldn't engage in any actions without written permission from TAL or its affiliates. This includes not employing an employee, director, officer, agent, or independent contractor, nor encouraging them to terminate their employment.

Clause 2 also starts with ""NON-SOLICITATION."" It's similar: during the same period, subscriber may engage in the same prohibited actions without written permission from TAL or its affiliates. So both clauses have the same structure and identical restrictions on what the subscriber can do without proper permissions.

Wait, but I need to check if there are any differences. Clause 1 says ""without the written permission,"" while Clause 2 also uses that phrase. They both mention encouraging or solicit employees or contractors to terminate their employment. So they seem exactly the same in terms of content and restrictions.

Is there anything else? Maybe legal nuances, but I don't think so. Both clauses require obtaining written consent before engaging or soliciting any employee or contractor for termination or modification. There's no difference in the prohibited actions themselves.

Therefore, I can conclude that both clauses mean the same thing.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 is called NON-SOLICITATION. It says that during the term of the agreement and for two years after its termination, non-renewal, the subscriber shouldn't engage or employ anyone from the Companies without written permission from TAL or any of their affiliates. They have to avoid engaging employees as employees (directors, directors, etc.), not even as directors. So part (a) is about direct employees and directors, and part (b) talks about any employee, director, officer, agent, or independent contractor—direct or indirect.

Clause 2 is PROHIBITION ON SOLICITATION. It also applies during the same period but instead of ""employee"" it says ""any employee, director, officer, agent, or independent contractor."" So both clauses require not encouraging or soliciting any employee/director/... from the Companies without written consent.

Wait, no—Clause 1 uses ""employee, director, officer, etc."" and Clause 2 uses ""any employee, director, etc."" That might make a difference. But the wording seems similar. Also, both clauses mention avoiding direct or indirect employees because part (a) says ""any employee"" but specifically excludes directors.

I think they're essentially the same. Both require no engagement with the Companies' employees except through directors if any. So I believe they're in the same category.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 starts by stating that during the term of the agreement and for two years after it ends, the Subscriber can't do certain things without TAL's written permission. The prohibited actions include engaging or employing anyone from TAL or its affiliates, whether for money or not. It also includes encouraging or soliciting employees, agents, etc., to terminate their relationship with the Companies.

Clause 2 is almost identical in structure but uses ""may"" instead of ""shall"". So it says the Subscriber may engage or employ the mentioned individuals without needing TAL's written permission. Then it continues similarly about encouraging or soliciting them to leave.

Hmm, so the main difference seems to be the word ""may"" vs. ""shall"". But does that change the meaning? In legal terms, ""shall"" is often considered a stronger term implying obligation, while ""may"" suggests permission. So if Clause 1 uses ""shall not"", it's prohibiting those actions without permission, whereas Clause 2 uses ""may"", which might imply permission to do those things.

Wait, but looking again, in Clause 1, theSubscriber ""shall not...without written permission..."" So they can't do those things unless TAL says so. In Clause 2, the Subscriber ""may...whether or not for monetary benefit, without the written permission..."". Wait, that seems contradictory. If it's a may clause, does it mean they are allowed to do those actions even without permission? That would be different from forbidding them.

But wait, in Clause 1, it's a prohibition: Subscriber shall not engage or employ anyone from TAL unless with written permission. In Clause 2, it says theSubscriber may engage or employ them, and also may encourage or solicit them to terminate their relationship without needing written permission.

Wait, that seems opposite. So Clause 2 is saying that during the term and for two years after, theSubscriber may do those things without TAL's written permission. That would mean they are allowed to approach TAL's employees, which would be conflicting with the standard non-solicitation clause which usually prohibits such actions.

But in Clause 1, it's a non-solicitation clause forbidding that. So if Clause 2 is allowing those actions without permission, that would make them different because one prohibits and the other allows.

Wait, but looking again: in Clause 2, it says ""Subscriber may, whether or not for monetary benefit, without the written permission... (a) engage..."", so it's allowing the Subscriber to approach TAL's employees. That seems like it's lifting the non-solicitation restriction, which is unusual because usually such clauses are to prevent poaching.

So that would mean Clauses 1 and 2 are different in their effect. Clause 1 prohibits certain actions without permission, while Clause 2 allows them without permission, which could have opposite implications on the agreement.

Alright, so I need to determine whether Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read through both clauses carefully.

Clause 1 is titled ""NON-SOLICITATION."" It states that during the term of the agreement and for two years after its termination, expiration, or non-renewal, the Subscriber can't do certain things without written permission from TAL or its affiliates. Specifically, they can't engage or hire any employees, directors, officers, agents, or independent contractors of the Companies, nor can they encourage or solicit these individuals to terminate or modify their relationships with the Companies.

Clause 2 is titled ""PROHIBITION ON SOLICITATION."" It also covers a similar time frame—the duration of the agreement and two years afterward. TheSubscriber agrees not to hire or engage any employees, directors, etc., without written consent from TAL or its affiliates. Additionally, they can't persuade or solicit these individuals to end their relationship with the Companies.

Looking at both clauses, they both talk about a prohibition on solicitation, preventing the hiring of employees from the Companies and encouraging them to leave. The key points are the same: duration (term and two years after), parties involved (Subscriber and TAL affiliates), actions prohibited (hiring/engaging and persuading/soliciting).

The only difference I notice is in the wording: Clause 1 uses ""non-solicitation"" and ""engage or employ,"" while Clause 2 uses ""prohibition on solicitation"" and ""hire or engage."" However, the legal terms used are synonymous. ""Non-solicitation"" and ""prohibition on solicitation"" essentially convey the same meaning in this context.

The prohibited actions are identical: hiring/engaging without permission and persuading/soliciting individuals to terminate their relationships. The time frames for both clauses also match—during the term and two years after termination or non-renewal.

Therefore, despite minor differences in wording, the clauses convey the same restrictions. They aim to prevent the Subscriber from interfering with current employees or inducing them to leave, which serves to protect the Companies' interests.

Cl1: Serono shall not solicit orders directly from any prospective purchaser with its principal place of business located outside the Territory.
Cl2: Serono may solicit orders directly from any prospective purchaser with its principal place of business located outside the Territory.

Hmm, at first glance, Cl1 says that there's a restriction, while Cl2 says it's permissible. They both seem to be talking about the same subject but in opposite ways—限制和允许。

I think they're using ""shall not"" and ""may"", which are different tenses. But maybe it's more about meaning than form. Both clauses are limiting the scope of what can happen, just in opposite grammatical forms.

Wait, maybe I should consider if there's a legal difference. In English, sometimes negative prohibitions can be expressed with ""shall not"" or through words like ""may"". But they have slightly different meanings. So perhaps even though it's phrased differently, the content is the same because both are restricting.

I'm leaning towards them being the same because the key points are about excluding certain solicitations and allowing others—both are about prohibited actions. The wording difference might just be in form and not meaning.

Clue 2: ""Serono is prohibited from directly seeking orders from any potential buyer whose main business operations are situated beyond the boundaries of the Territory."" It uses ""potential buyer"" and says their main business is beyond the territory.

Hmm, so both clauses talk about Serono not handling direct order solicitations. The key difference seems to be who they're referring to. Clue 1 specifically mentions prospective purchaser with the principal place outside, while Clue 2 refers to potential buyers whose businesses are beyond.

I think ""prospective purchaser"" is more like a businessperson considering entering the territory or something, whereas ""potential buyer"" might be more general, maybe someone interested in opening up. So their main differences are who they're targeting and how they describe it. 

Therefore, I believe these clauses mean different things. They both prevent direct solicitations but target different groups.

Clause 1 says: ""Serono shall not solicit orders directly from any prospective purchaser with its principal place of business located outside the Territory."" So, this is saying that Serono is forbidden to approach or ask for orders directly from potential customers whose main office isn't in the Territory.

Clause 2 states: ""Serono may solicit orders directly from any prospective purchaser with its principal place of business located outside the Territory."" This is the opposite; it's stating that Serono is allowed to do this.

At first glance, they seem to be opposites because one prohibits the action and the other permits it. But I should consider if there are any nuances or specific conditions where this might not be the case. Maybe the Territory has a specific definition that's important here. If the Territory is defined in such a way that ""located outside"" and ""soliciting orders directly"" have precise meanings, then these clauses would indeed mean the opposite of each other.

I don't see any ambiguity in their wording. Clause 1 uses ""shall not,"" which is a strong prohibition, while Clause 2 uses ""may,"" which is permissive. So they are direct opposites. Therefore, they must be different.

Hmm. Both clauses are about Serono not doing direct solicitations or seeking orders from buyers outside the Territory. The wording is slightly different: ""principal place of business"" versus ""main business operations."" But I think they both mean the same thing because a principal place of business is where the company operates, so it's equivalent to main business operations.

The main difference in wording might be ""prohibited from directly seeking"" vs. ""shall not solicit orders directly,"" but both are about direct actions. So, regardless of the slight variation in phrasing, the meaning that Serono can't directly approach these customers outside the Territory remains the same.

Clause 2 states: ""Serono may solicit orders directly from any prospective purchaser with its principal place of business located outside the Territory."" This one seems to allow Serono to do the exact opposite—meaning they are permitted to solicit orders from those same purchasers outside the territory.

The key difference here is the verbs used. Clause 1 uses ""shall not,"" which is a prohibition, while Clause 2 uses ""may,"" indicating permission. So, one clause forbids an action, and the other permits it. That makes them opposites in terms of what they allow or restrict Serono from doing.

I don't see any overlap where both could be interpreted similarly. The first clearly restricts solicitation outside the territory, while the second allows it. Therefore, these clauses have opposite meanings.

Clause 2 states: ""Serono is prohibited from directly seeking orders from any potential buyer whose main business operations are situated beyond the boundaries of the Territory.""

Alright, let's break them down.

First, both clauses are about Serono not doing something related to soliciting or seeking orders. The subject in both is Serono, so that's consistent.

In Clause 1, it uses ""solicit orders directly"" and refers to ""prospective purchaser."" The location condition is the principal place of business being outside the Territory.

Clause 2 says ""directly seeking orders,"" which seems similar to soliciting. It uses ""potential buyer"" instead of prospective purchaser, but those terms are pretty much interchangeable in this context. The location part here mentions ""main business operations situated beyond the boundaries,"" so beyond the Territory as well.

So both clauses prohibit Serono from directly obtaining orders from buyers whose main businesses are outside the specified area. The wording is slightly different—like ""solicit"" vs. ""seeking""—but they convey the same restriction.

I don't see any differences in meaning here; it's just a matter of phrasing. Therefore, these clauses have the same meaning.

Clause 2 is exactly the same as the first one. They both mention ""shall not make/accept... unless"" and the time frame is two years plus 90 days, with termination up to that period.

Hmm, maybe they're asking if there's any nuance I'm missing. Both clauses specify a term excepted by agreement in writing, and the exclusion applies for the Term of the Agreement and two years after, regardless of termination within 90 days unless the other party becomes insolvent.

Wait, perhaps ""shall not"" is different from ""may not."" In English, ""shall"" often implies obligation, while ""may not"" just says it's not allowed. But in legal terms, both clauses use ""shall not,"" which means they are obligations, not permissions. So that might make them the same.

Alternatively, maybe there's a difference in formality or wording style? They look very similar except for any typos or formatting differences I'm missing. There are no additional words like articles or prepositions differentiating their meanings.

I think the answer is they're the same because all relevant clauses are identical. So the response should be ""Same.""

**Answer:** Same","<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. So, I'm looking at both Clause 1 and Clause 2. 

Clause 1 says that NONHIRE is about not making offers regarding employment between the parties unless one of them becomes insolvent within 90 days. It mentions employees being terminated in that time frame.

Then, it extends this exception for two years after the agreement ends, regardless of termination. So, even if an employee is taken out of the picture quickly, the other can still have their offers rejected or accepted.

Clause 2 starts with ""EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS."" It says unless a written agreement specifies otherwise, neither party shouldn't engage in employment arrangements involving each other's employees during this Agreement and two years after. Same timeframe as before. And it also mentions termination within ninety days is subject to this restriction, with an exception for insolvency.

So, the main points: both clauses mention exceptions for insolvent parties, but Clause 1 talks about the possibility of rejection even if terminated quickly, while Clause 2 emphasizes that this exception only applies during a specific period. Also, Clause 1 doesn't limit this exception to any particular party, whereas in Clause 2, it's conditional on no written agreement otherwise.

Wait, actually, both clauses start by specifying that unless a written agreement exists, they can't engage in these arrangements. So, the difference seems to be more about how the exception is applied. In Clause 1, the exception applies regardless of who becomes insolvent, even if someone gets terminated within ninety days. But in Clause 2, I think it's only during the duration of this Agreement and two years afterward, not considering specific parties.

But actually, looking again, both clauses mention that if no agreement exists, they can't engage in employment arrangements for the specified period, including termination within 90 days. The difference is that Clause 1 allows for acceptance or rejection unless insolvency, even after a short-term termination. Clause 2's exception only applies during the term and two years post- Agreement.

So, the key differentiator is that in Clause 1, it's an offer (acceptance of) that can be made regardless of whether someone gets fired quickly, while in Clause 2, the exception only applies within the specific duration. So yes, they are different.

Clause 1 says that during this time, the parties shall not make or accept any offers regarding employment or services unless the other party becomes insolvent. So, they can't offer or accept jobs from each other's employees for two years post-termination, except if the other party is insolvent.

Clause 2 is almost identical but flips the wording. It says they may make or accept any offers during that period unless the other party becomes insolvent. Wait, so in Clause 1, it's about not making or accepting unless insolvent, whereas Clause 2 allows making or accepting unless insolvent. That seems contradictory.

Wait no, both are starting with ""NONHIRE,"" but Clause 2 says they may make or accept offers, which sounds like the opposite of not making or accepting. So one is a restriction and the other allows it, except for insolvency.

So maybe they have different implications. One restricts unless insolvency, the other permits unless insolvency. That would mean they're opposites, so the meaning is different.

Clause 1: NONHIRE.

Clause 2: EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. It states that unless a written agreement specifies otherwise, they agree not to engage in any employment or independent contractor arrangements involving each other's employees for the duration and two years after. This restriction also applies to employees terminated within the past 90 days. An exception is if the opposing party becomes insolvent.

Hmm. Both clauses talk about restrictions related to hiring or employing each other's employees, including recent terminations. Both mention a two-year period post-termination. Both allow an exception when the other party is insolvent.

Wait, but what's the difference in wording? Clause 1 is titled NONHIRE and talks about not making or accepting offers for employment. Clause 2 is EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS, talking about not engaging in arrangements involving their employees.

Are they essentially saying the same thing just with different wording? They both restrict hiring each other's employees and include a two-year period, even after termination. The exception for insolvency is also present in both.

I think the key points are identical: restriction on hiring/employing others' employees for two years post-termination, includes recent terminations within 90 days, unless the opposing party is insolvent. So they have the same meaning.

Wait a minute. Clause 1 uses ""shall not,"" which is a prohibition—meaning they can't hire each other's employees under normal circumstances. Clause 2 uses ""may,"" which suggests permission—they are allowed to make or accept offers. So one forbids it, the other allows it unless certain conditions apply.

The only exception in both is if the other party becomes insolvent, then presumably the non-hire restriction doesn't apply. But otherwise, the main difference is whether they can hire or cannot hire.

Looking at the content: Both clauses have similar restrictions on hiring each other's employees, including recent terminations, for the same duration (during and two years post-Agreement). The exceptions are both tied to insolvency.

The main differences seem to be in wording. Clause 1 says ""make or accept any offer,"" while Clause 2 refers to ""engaging in any employment or independent contractor arrangements."" Both essentially restrict hiring, so the meaning is the same.

First, looking at Clause 1: ""D. No Solicitation."" Sponsor agrees that it will not solicit or otherwise encourage any employee of any Covance Entity with whom it has contact pursuant to this Agreement to seek employment with Sponsor throughout the course of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter.""

Clue 1 is about not soliciting, which means they don't engage in any type of solicitation related to their business. The main point here is that there's no invitation or any kind of encouragement they are prohibited from doing.

Now, Clause 2: ""D. Solicitation."" Sponsor agrees that it may solicit or otherwise encourage any employee of any Covance Entity with whom it has contact pursuant to this Agreement to seek employment with Sponsor throughout the course of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter.""

Here, Clause 2 uses ""solicitation"" instead of ""no Solicitation."" It's using ""may solicit,"" which is more flexible. The first clause was about not doing it at all, while the second allows them to do it but with conditions.

I think these are slightly different because in one case, they have a strict prohibition, and in the other, there's an exception—allowing some conduct as long as certain conditions are met, like having contact. Also, ""no solicitation"" is more restrictive than just ""solicitation,"" which can happen under specific circumstances.

So overall, I believe these clauses are different because one prohibits any solicitation and the other allows some but with additional conditions.

Clause 1 says: ""D. No Solicitation.

Clause 2 is: ""D. Non-Solicitation. Throughout the duration of this Agreement and for a subsequent period of twelve (12) months, the Sponsor commits to refraining from soliciting or incentivizing any employees of any Covance Entity that it interacts with under this Agreement to pursue employment with the Sponsor.""

Hmm, at first glance, they seem similar. Both start with ""D. Non-Solicitation."" and mention that the sponsor agrees not to solicit or otherwise encourage. But I should look more closely.

In Clause 1, it says ""solicitation"" without specifying who else. So it's about not encouraging anyone from Covance Entities. In Clause 2, ""non-solicitation"" is a bit vague but still implies avoiding soliciting or incentivizing employees. 

Wait, the key difference might be in whether they specify who to avoid or not. Clause 1 explicitly mentions ""employees of any Covance Entity,"" whereas Clause 2 just says ""employees."" That makes me think that Clause 2 might be too broad and doesn't restrict the company from interacting with others, only preventing contact within the Covance Entities.

So while both clauses protect the company from contacting employees who aren't part of their network, one specifies the exact group (Covance Entities) and the other just avoids interacting. That means Clause 1 is more targeted and precise, whereas Clause 2 is less specific but still covers a similar purpose.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or if they're different. Let me start by reading them carefully.

Clause 1 is titled ""No Solicitation."" It says that Sponsor agrees not to solicit or encourage any employee of Covance Entity with whom it has contact under this Agreement for twelve months after the Agreement ends.

Clause 2 is titled ""Solicitation."" It states that Sponsor may solicit or otherwise encourage employees of Covance with whom they have contact under the Agreement, again for twelve months after the Agreement's term.

Hmm. At first glance, one says ""not to"" do something, and the other allows ""to"" do it. So, are these opposing clauses?

Wait, but both mention the same duration: twelve months after the Agreement. The key difference is whether Sponsor can or cannot solicit. In Clause 1, it's a prohibition, while in Clause 2, it's permission to do so.

So, if Sponsor is allowed by one clause and prohibited by another, that would mean they have opposite meanings. Unless there's more nuance I'm missing, like maybe the first applies to existing employees and the second allows for new hires, but that's not explicitly stated here.

I think it's clear that one restricts and the other permits the same action. Therefore, their meanings are different.

Okay, so I need to figure out if Clauses 1 and 2 have the same meaning or not. Let me read them again carefully.

Clause 1 starts with ""D. No Solicitation."" It says that the Sponsor agrees they won't solicit or encourage any employee of Covance Entity they're in contact with during the agreement, and this restriction lasts for twelve months after the agreement ends.

Clause 2 is labeled ""D. Non-Solicitation."" It states that throughout the agreement's duration and for a subsequent twelve months, the Sponsor commits to not soliciting or incentivizing any employees of Covance Entity they interact with under the agreement to come work at Sponsor.

Hmm, both clauses mention not soliciting or encouraging employees from Covance to join Sponsor. They both have a twelve-month period after the agreement ends. So they're talking about similar things—restricting the Sponsor from poaching employees during and after the agreement.

Wait, but in Clause 1, it's specifically mentioning ""employees of any Covance Entity with whom it has contact pursuant to this Agreement."" In Clause 2, it's ""any employees of any Covance Entity that it interacts with under this Agreement."" So they both refer to interactions under the agreement. That seems consistent.

Also, both clauses include a twelve-month post-termination period. So the duration and scope are the same in terms of what's prohibited.

I don't see a significant difference in their wording or intent. They both aim to prevent the Sponsor from enticing Covance employees to leave for the same employer after the agreement ends.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through them carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""D. No Solicitation. Sponsor agrees that it will not solicit or otherwise encourage any employee of any Covance Entity with whom it has contact pursuant to this Agreement to seek employment with Sponsor throughout the course of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter.""

So, from what I understand, this clause is about prohibiting the Sponsor from soliciting employees of Covance. The key words here are ""will not solicit"" and ""otherwise encourage."" It seems like it's restricting the Sponsor from trying to poach employees during the agreement and for a year after.

Now, looking at Clause 2: ""D. Solicitation. Sponsor agrees that it may solicit or otherwise encourage any employee of any Covance Entity with whom it has contact pursuant to this Agreement to seek employment with Sponsor throughout the course of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter.""

This one is titled ""Solicitation,"" which immediately stands out as different from Clause 1's ""No Solicitation."" The language here says the Sponsor ""may solicit"" or encourage employees. So instead of a prohibition, this seems to allow the Sponsor to do exactly what Clause 1 forbids.

Breaking it down further: both clauses are about the Sponsor and their interactions with Covance employees regarding employment opportunities. However, the first clause explicitly prohibits such actions for the duration and beyond the agreement, while the second allows them. The difference in wording is clear—Clause 1 uses ""will not,"" whereas Clause 2 uses ""may.""

I don't see any overlap or ambiguity here. One restricts solicitation, the other permits it. There's no middle ground; they're directly opposing each other in terms of what the Sponsor is allowed to do concerning Covance employees.

Okay, I need to determine whether these two legal clauses have the same meaning or are different. Let me read both carefully.

Clause 1 says that the Sponsor agrees not to solicit or encourage any employee of a Covance Entity they come into contact with through the Agreement during its term and for 12 months after. It uses ""solicit"" and ""encourage,"" and mentions employees the Sponsor has contact with as part of the Agreement.

Clause 2 states that the Sponsor commits throughout the duration of the Agreement plus 12 months afterward to not solicit or incentivize any Covance Entity employees they interact with under the Agreement. Here, it uses ""solicit"" and ""incentivizing,"" and refers to employees the Sponsor interacts with as part of the Agreement.

Both clauses are about a no-solicitation commitment for 12 months beyond the Agreement's term. They both cover interactions during and after the agreement period. The main difference is in wording: Clause 1 uses ""encourage"" while Clause 2 uses ""incentivizing."" Also, one says ""contact,"" the other ""interact with.""

I need to see if these differences are significant. Encouraging could include a broader range of actions, whereas incentivizing might imply offering something in return. However, both terms effectively prevent the Sponsor from enticing Covance employees to leave for their company.

Considering legal contexts, slight variations in wording don't necessarily change the meaning. Both aim to restrict recruitment efforts during and after the agreement. So, despite minor differences in phrasing, they essentially convey the same restriction.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 says: ""During the terms of this Agreement, Client shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit orders from any doctor referred by Consultant or other Consultant customer that has been referred to Client without Consultant’s written approval. (ii) solicit any sales agents of Consultant without Consultant’s written approval.""

Clause 2 is identical except for ""solicit"" and ""solicitation."" So the wording seems almost exactly the same, just with a typo in 'solicitation' instead of 's solicit.'

I think these are two versions of the same thing. Maybe one was misspelled, or perhaps both were meant to be the same but had some slight differences. Since they're essentially the same under standard grammar rules, I don't see why they would be different. They might even mean the same law in terms of what it prohibits.

So I think they're the same.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if these two legal clauses are the same or different. Let me read through both carefully.

Clause 1 is in English and says: ""During the terms of this Agreement, Client shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit orders from any doctor referred by Consultant or other consultants customer that has been referred to Client without Consultant’s written approval. (ii) solicit any sales agents of Consultant without Consultant’s written approval.""

Clause 2 is in Chinese and translates roughly: ""Clause 2.5 Restriction on Solicitation. Throughout the duration of this Agreement, the Client agrees not to, either directly or through indirect means, pursue the following actions without obtaining written consent from the Consultant: (i) seek orders from any physician or other customer introduced to them by the Consultant, or (ii) attempt to recruit any sales representatives employed by the Consultant.""

Hmm. Both clauses have similar phrases. Let's break it down.

Clause 1 starts with ""2.5 Non-Solicitation."" Then lists two actions: (i) solicit orders from doctors referred by Consultingants without their written approval, and (ii) solicit sales agents of Consultingists without their written approval.

Clause 2 translates to the same list, but in Chinese. The key words are ""non-solicitation"" and ""restrictions on solicitation."" Both clauses specify that soliciting should not be done without written consent from the Consultingist or their representatives.

So, even though they're in different languages, the meaning seems identical. There's no subtlety or nuance between the two because both list specific prohibited actions with exact wording.

I don't see any differences in the legal meaning here. Both clauses are enforcing that Consultingists and their agents cannot perform solicitation without written consent.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Clauses 1 and 2 are the same or different. Let me read them carefully.

Clause 1 says that the Client shouldn't ""solicit orders"" from doctors referred by the Consultant or other Consultant customers without written approval. It also says they can't solicit any sales agents of Consultant without approval.

Clause 2 is almost identical but starts with ""may,"" not ""shall."" So it says the Client ""may"" do those things without prior written approval, but wait, no—it's a bit confusing. Wait, actually, in Clause 2, it's still saying that the Client may or may not do these things, but I need to parse it correctly.

Wait, no. Let me read again. Clause 1: ""Client shall not"" do (i) and (ii). So it's a prohibition on doing those actions without approval.

Clause 2: ""Client may, directly or indirectly, (i) ... without Consultant’s written approval."" Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, actually, in Clause 2, the first part is ""may,"" but then the (i) and (ii) are the same as Clause 1. But wait, no—Clause 1 says Client shall not do these things without approval, while Clause 2 starts with ""Client may..."" So maybe it's allowing the Client to do those actions? Or is it a typo?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read each clause again.

Clause 1: Non-Solicitation. During the terms of this Agreement, Client shall not (i) solicit orders from any doctor referred by Consultant without written approval; (ii) solicit any sales agents of Consultant without written approval.

Clause 2: Non-Solicitation. During the terms of this Agreement, Client may (i) and (ii). Wait, that can't be right because it's still saying ""may"" but then listing things they shouldn't do. Maybe I'm misreading it.

Wait, perhaps Clause 2 is actually similar to Clause 1 in structure. Let me check:

Clause 1: Client shall not do X without approval.
Clause 2: Client may do Y without approval.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the wording seems similar but starts with ""may."" Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be ""shall not"" as in Clause 1. Or perhaps it's intended to mean the same thing but phrased differently.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that both clauses are under Non-Solicitation and mention two specific prohibitions: soliciting doctors referred by Consultant without approval and soliciting sales agents without approval.

In Clause 1, it's a clear prohibition: Client shall not do these things without written approval.

In Clause 2, the wording is slightly different. It starts with ""Client may"" but then the same actions are prohibited. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if they may do something, why list prohibitions? Maybe it's a mistake and should be ""shall not.""

Alternatively, perhaps in Clause 2, ""may"" is used to mean permission, so the Client has the option to do these things with approval. But actually, both clauses are about what the Client can't do without approval.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse each clause again.

Clause 1: During the terms of this Agreement, Client shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit orders... without written approval; (ii) solicit any sales agents...

Clause 2: During the terms of this Agreement, Client may, directly or indirectly, (i) and (ii)... without Consultant’s written approval.

Wait, that can't be right because if it's allowing them to do these things, then they're not prohibited. But the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps in Clause 2, ""may"" is a typo and should be ""shall not."" Or maybe it's intended to mean that the Client has the option to do those things but only with approval.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference lies in the use of ""may"" vs. ""shall not."" If ""may"" is used correctly, then perhaps Clause 2 is more permissive, allowing the Client to do these actions when they have approval, whereas Clause 1 prohibits them outright without any permission.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because both clauses are about prohibitions. Let me think again.

In Clause 1: Client cannot do (i) and (ii) without written approval.

In Clause 2: It says ""Client may... (i)... without Consultant’s written approval."" So maybe it's allowing them to do it, but only with approval, which is similar to Clause 1. Wait, no—Clause 1 prohibits doing it without approval, meaning they can't do it unless approved.

Clause 2 says Client may do these things without approval. That would mean they are allowed to do them even without approval, which contradicts Clause 1's prohibition.

Wait, that can't be right because the two clauses are both under Non-Solicitation. So if Clause 2 allows doing (i) and (ii) without approval, then it's conflicting with Clause 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the structure. Let me check again.

Clause 1: Client shall not do (i) and (ii) without written approval.

Clause 2: Client may, directly or indirectly, do (i) and (ii) without written approval.

So in Clause 2, it's saying that the Client can do those things without approval, which contradicts Clause 1. Therefore, they are different because one prohibits without approval and the other allows them with approval.

But wait, both clauses seem to be about what the Client cannot do without permission. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo in Clause 2, where ""may"" should be ""shall not."" If that were the case, then they would be the same.

But assuming the wording is correct as given, then Clause 2 allows the Client to do those things without approval, whereas Clause 1 prohibits them. So they are different.

Wait, no—Clause 1 is about prohibition: Client shall not do (i) and (ii) without written approval.

Clause 2 says Client may do (i) and (ii) without written approval, which would mean they can do it even without approval, which contradicts Clause 1's prohibition. Therefore, the two clauses are different because one prohibits without approval and the other allows with or without.

But wait, that can't be right because both are under Non-Solicitation. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe in Clause 2, ""may"" is used incorrectly, and it's intended to mean the same as ""shall not."" But if it's correctly written, then they are different.

I think the key difference is that Clause 1 uses ""shall not"" while Clause 2 uses ""may,"" which implies a permission to do something without approval. Therefore, they are different because one prohibits and the other allows.

Clause 1 is titled ""Non-Solicitation."" It states that during the term of the agreement, the Client shouldn't directly or indirectly do two things: (i) solicit orders from doctors referred by a Consultant without written approval, and (ii) solicit any sales agents of the Consultant without approval.

Clause 2 is called ""Restriction on Solicitation."" It says throughout the duration of the agreement, the Client agrees not to, either directly or through indirect means, pursue certain actions without written consent. Specifically, it mentions seeking orders from physicians introduced by the Consultant and attempting to recruit sales representatives employed by the Consultant.

Looking at both clauses, they both prohibit the Client from soliciting doctors referred by Consultants or the Consultant's sales agents. They use similar wording for the prohibited actions: ""solicit"" and ""seek orders,"" and they require written approval before doing so. Both also mention that this applies throughout the agreement, either directly or indirectly.

However, I notice that Clause 1 specifically mentions ""any doctor referred by Consultant or other Consultant customer,"" which might imply a broader group beyond just doctors, while Clause 2 in (i) refers to ""physicians"" and in (ii) to ""sales representatives."" The terms used are slightly different: ""solicit orders"" vs. ""seek orders,"" but that's likely synonymous.

I'm wondering if there's any nuance in the wording or scope. Clause 1 seems to include a reference to ""other Consultant customer,"" which might extend beyond just doctors, but Clause 2 uses ""physician"" and doesn't specify further. However, both clauses are about not soliciting without written approval from the Consultant.

Given that both clauses cover the same prohibited actions with similar language, I think they mean the same thing.

Alright, so I've got these two legal clauses about non-solicitation. Let me read them carefully and try to figure out if they mean the same thing or not.

Clause 1 says that during the agreement, the Client shall not, directly or indirectly, do two things: (i) solicit orders from doctors referred by the Consultant without written approval, and (ii) solicit any sales agents of the Consultant without written approval. So it's a prohibition; they can't do these things unless approved in writing.

Clause 2 looks similar at first glance. It starts with ""Client may"" instead of ""shall not."" Wait, that's a big difference. ""May"" implies permission or allowance, whereas ""shall not"" means it's prohibited. So clause 2 is saying the Client can solicit orders from doctors referred by the Consultant without approval and can also solicit sales agents without approval.

So one is restricting the Client from doing these actions unless they get written approval, and the other is allowing them to do so without needing that approval. That seems like a significant difference in meaning.

I should make sure I'm not missing anything else. Both clauses are under section 2.5 Non-Solicitation, but the verbs ""shall not"" vs. ""may"" completely change what's being said. There's no other part of the clauses that would override this main point. So yeah, they're definitely different.

Clause 1 is about Non-Solicitation. It says that during the agreement, the Client can't directly or indirectly do two things: (i) solicit orders from doctors referred by the Consultant without written approval and (ii) solicit any sales agents of the Consultant without their written approval. 

Now, Clause 2 is titled Restriction on Solicitation. It mentions that throughout the agreement, the Client agrees not to pursue certain actions without written consent. Those actions are: (i) seeking orders from physicians or other customers introduced by the Consultant and (ii) attempting to recruit sales representatives employed by the Consultant.

Looking at both clauses, they both restrict the Client's ability to solicit orders from people referred by the Consultant and to recruit their sales agents. The wording is slightly different but seems to cover the same points. Clause 1 uses ""solicit"" while Clause 2 uses ""seek"" and ""attempt to recruit."" However, these verbs essentially mean the same thing in this context.

Both clauses mention that written approval or consent from the Consultant is required for these actions. The structure is similar with two main restrictions, each clearly defined. 

I don't see any significant differences in what they're prohibiting. They both cover solicitation of customers referred by the Consultant and recruitment of their sales staff, requiring prior written permission. Therefore, they seem to have the same meaning.
