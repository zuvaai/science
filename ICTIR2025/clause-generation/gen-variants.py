The rewritten clause should use different sentence structures, alternative phrasing, and varied word choices, but it must not change the intent, obligations, or rights described. Avoid simply replacing words with synonymsâ€”focus on restructuring sentences while maintaining clarity and legal precision. If the original clause includes a title, provide a reworded version of the title. However, if no title is present, do not create one.\"
